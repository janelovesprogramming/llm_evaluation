1;gemini-pro;frequency;How many people are affected by Stormorken syndrome ?;Stormorken syndrome is a rare disorder. Approximately a dozen cases have been reported in the medical literature.;Stormorken syndrome is an extremely rare genetic disorder with only a few reported cases worldwide, making it difficult to determine the exact number of individuals affected. The rarity of the condition and the limited number of documented cases hinder the establishment of a precise prevalence or incidence rate. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific numerical value regarding the number of people affected by Stormorken syndrome.;0.029;14.0;58.0;0.237;0.06;0.203;0.817;0.234;0.397;0.079
2;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is PDGFRB-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia inherited ?;PDGFRB-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia is not inherited and occurs in people with no history of the condition in their families. Chromosomal rearrangements that lead to a PDGFRB fusion gene are somatic mutations, which are mutations acquired during a person's lifetime and present only in certain cells. The somatic mutation occurs initially in a single cell, which continues to grow and divide, producing a group of cells with the same mutation (a clonal population).;PDGFRB-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) is a rare hematologic malignancy characterized by persistent eosinophilia (>1.5 × 10^9/L) and the presence of a specific genetic abnormality involving the PDGFRB gene. This abnormality, typically a mutation or rearrangement involving exon 12 of PDGFRB, leads to the activation of the PDGFRB tyrosine kinase and subsequent downstream signaling, promoting the proliferation and survival of eosinophils. PDGFRB-associated CEL is not typically inherited, and most cases occur sporadically without a clear family history of the disease. However, there have been rare reports of familial cases and studies suggesting a possible genetic predisposition in some individuals, indicating that further research is needed to fully elucidate the role of genetic factors in the development of PDGFRB-associated CEL.;0.038;65.0;106.0;0.25;0.072;0.203;0.798;0.155;0.2;0.107
3;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is pulmonary arterial hypertension inherited ?;"Pulmonary arterial hypertension is usually sporadic, which means it occurs in individuals with no known family history of the disorder. These non-familial cases are described as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. About 20 percent of these cases are caused by mutations in one of the genes known to be associated with the disease, but most of the time a causative gene mutation has not been identified.  Inherited cases of this disorder are known as familial pulmonary arterial hypertension. When the condition is inherited, it most often has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. However, many people with an altered gene never develop pulmonary arterial hypertension; this phenomenon is called reduced penetrance.";Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) can be inherited, as there are several genetic mutations that have been identified as potential causes. These mutations affect genes involved in various cellular pathways, such as signaling, growth, and apoptosis. Inherited PAH is often associated with a family history of the condition and can be passed down through generations. It is important to note that not all cases of PAH are inherited, as there can be other underlying causes such as connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, and certain medications. Genetic testing may be recommended for individuals with a family history of PAH or in cases where no other cause can be identified.;0.036;117.0;105.0;0.392;0.08;0.224;0.821;0.068;0.057;0.076

5;gemini-pro;frequency;How many people are affected by Proteus syndrome ?;Proteus syndrome is a rare condition with an incidence of less than 1 in 1 million people worldwide. Only a few hundred affected individuals have been reported in the medical literature.  Researchers believe that Proteus syndrome may be overdiagnosed, as some individuals with other conditions featuring asymmetric overgrowth have been mistakenly diagnosed with Proteus syndrome. To make an accurate diagnosis, most doctors and researchers now follow a set of strict guidelines that define the signs and symptoms of Proteus syndrome.;Proteus syndrome is an extremely rare genetic condition that affects approximately 1 in 1,000,000 people worldwide. Due to its rarity, there is limited data on its prevalence, and the number of affected individuals may vary depending on the geographic region or population studied. Estimates suggest that there are fewer than 1,000 known cases of Proteus syndrome worldwide, with a slightly higher prevalence in males than in females. The condition can manifest differently in each affected individual, and the severity of symptoms can range from mild to severe. It is characterized by various medical complications, including overgrowth of body parts, skin abnormalities, and vascular malformations.;0.039;73.0;98.0;0.323;0.073;0.246;0.885;0.189;0.253;0.125

Steps          Healthy Eating                     - Follow the healthy eating plan that you and your doctor or dietitian have made.      - Learn what to eat to keep your blood glucose levels under control.      - Make wise food choices to help you feel good every day and to lose weight if needed.            Blood Glucose                     - Check your blood glucose every day.      - Each time you check your blood glucose, write the number in a record book to share with your health care team.      - Treat low blood glucose quickly.            Physical Activity                     - Even small amounts of physical activity help manage diabetes. Aim for 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity most days of the week. Children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes who are 10 to 17 years old should aim for 60 minutes of activity every day.      - Not all physical activity has to take place at the same time.      - Do aerobic activities, such as brisk walking, which use your large muscles to make your heart beat faster. The large muscles are those of the upper and lower arms and legs and those that control head, shoulder, and hip movements.      - Do activities to strengthen muscles and bone, such as lifting weights or sit-ups. Aim for two times a week.      - Stretch to increase your flexibility, lower stress, and help prevent muscle soreness after physical activity.      - Increase daily activity by decreasing time spent watching TV or at the computer. Children and adolescents should limit screen time not related to school to less than 2 hours per day. Limiting screen time can help you meet your physical activity goal.      - Always talk with your doctor before you start a new physical activity program.            Medicines                     - Take your medicines as directed, including insulin if ordered by your doctor.

Treatment options for SBS vary depending on the severity of the condition and the individual's nutritional needs. For mild cases, dietary modifications and oral nutritional supplements may be sufficient. In more severe cases, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may be necessary to provide adequate nutrition. Surgical options include intestinal lengthening procedures, such as serial transverse enteroplasty (STEP) or longitudinal intestinal lengthening and tailoring (LILT), which aim to increase the length of the functional small intestine and improve absorption. Additionally, medications such as antidiarrheals, proton pump inhibitors, and antibiotics may be used to manage symptoms and complications associated with SBS. The primary goal of treatment is to maintain adequate nutrition and hydration, prevent complications, and improve overall quality of life for individuals with SBS.;0.012;18.0;133.0;0.133;0.028;0.057;0.608;-0.135;0.024;-0.287
9;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Neuropathy ataxia retinitis pigmentosa syndrome ?;"Neuropathy ataxia retinitis pigmentosa (NARP) syndrome is characterized by a variety of signs and symptoms that mainly affect the nervous system. Beginning in childhood or early adulthood, most people with NARP experience numbness, tingling, or pain in the arms and legs (sensory neuropathy); muscle weakness; and problems with balance and coordination (ataxia). Affected individuals may also have vision loss caused by a condition called retinitis pigmentosa. Other features of NARP include learning disabilities, developmental delay, seizures, dementia, hearing loss, and cardiac conduction defects. Mutations in the MT-ATP6 gene cause NARP syndrome. This gene is located within mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Most individuals with NARP have a specific MT-ATP6 mutation in 70 percent to 90 percent of their mitochondria. NARP syndrome is inherited from the mother (maternal inheritance) because only females pass mitochondrial DNA to their children.";Neuropathy ataxia retinitis pigmentosa syndrome (NARP) is a rare, inherited mitochondrial disorder that affects multiple systems of the body, including the nervous system, muscles, and eyes. It is caused by mutations in the MT-ATP6 gene, which encodes a protein that is essential for the function of mitochondria, the energy-producing units of cells. NARP typically presents in childhood or early adulthood with symptoms such as muscle weakness, poor coordination, difficulty with balance and walking, vision loss, and hearing loss. Other symptoms may include seizures, intellectual disability, and psychiatric problems. There is currently no cure for NARP, but treatment focuses on managing the symptoms and improving the quality of life for affected individuals.;0.104;128.0;102.0;0.474;0.171;0.301;0.927;0.231;0.19;0.271

11;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Aphasia ?;Aphasia is a disorder caused by damage to the parts of the brain that control language. It can make it hard for you to read, write, and say what you mean to say. It is most common in adults who have had a stroke. Brain tumors, infections, injuries, and dementia can also cause it. The type of problem you have and how bad it is depends on which part of your brain is damaged and how much damage there is.     There are four main types:       -  Expressive aphasia - you know what you want to say, but you have trouble saying or writing what you mean     -  Receptive aphasia - you hear the voice or see the print, but you can't make sense of the words     -  Anomic aphasia - you have trouble using the correct word for objects, places, or events     -  Global aphasia - you can't speak, understand speech, read, or write        Some people recover from aphasia without treatment.

12;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency ?;Mutations in the G6PD gene cause glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.  The G6PD gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. This enzyme is involved in the normal processing of carbohydrates. It also protects red blood cells from the effects of potentially harmful molecules called reactive oxygen species. Reactive oxygen species are byproducts of normal cellular functions. Chemical reactions involving glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase produce compounds that prevent reactive oxygen species from building up to toxic levels within red blood cells.  If mutations in the G6PD gene reduce the amount of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase or alter its structure, this enzyme can no longer play its protective role. As a result, reactive oxygen species can accumulate and damage red blood cells. Factors such as infections, certain drugs, or ingesting fava beans can increase the levels of reactive oxygen species, causing red blood cells to be destroyed faster than the body can replace them. A reduction in the amount of red blood cells causes the signs and symptoms of hemolytic anemia.  Researchers believe that carriers of a G6PD mutation may be partially protected against malaria, an infectious disease carried by a certain type of mosquito. A reduction in the amount of functional glucose-6-dehydrogenase appears to make it more difficult for this parasite to invade red blood cells. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency occurs most frequently in areas of the world where malaria is common.;;0.0;208.0;1.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;-0.039;-0.465;-0.718;-0.185
13;gemini-pro;treatment;What are the treatments for Diverticular Disease ?;"Diverticulitis can attack suddenly and cause complications, such as
                
- an abscessa painful, swollen, pus-filled area just outside the colon wallcaused by infection  - a perforationa small tear or hole in the diverticula  - peritonitisinflammation of tissues inside the abdomen from pus and stool that leak through a perforation  - a fistulaan abnormal passage, or tunnel, between two organs, or between an organ and the outside of the body  - intestinal obstructionpartial or total blockage of movement of food or stool through the intestines
                
These complications need to be treated to prevent them from getting worse and causing serious illness. In some cases, surgery may be needed.
                
Abscess, perforation, and peritonitis. Antibiotic treatment of diverticulitis usually prevents or treats an abscess. If the abscess is large or does not clear up with antibiotics, it may need to be drained. After giving the person numbing medication, a radiologist inserts a needle through the skin to the abscess and then drains the fluid through a catheter. The procedure is usually guided by an abdominal ultrasound or a CT scan. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure.
                
A person with a perforation usually needs surgery to repair the tear or hole. Sometimes, a person needs surgery to remove a small part of the intestine if the perforation cannot be repaired.
                
A person with peritonitis may be extremely ill, with nausea, vomiting, fever, and severe abdominal tenderness. This condition requires immediate surgery to clean the abdominal cavity and possibly a colon resection at a later date after a course of antibiotics. A blood transfusion may be needed if the person has lost a significant amount of blood. Without prompt treatment, peritonitis can be fatal.
                
Fistula. Diverticulitis-related infection may lead to one or more fistulas. Fistulas usually form between the colon and the bladder, small intestine, or skin. The most common type of fistula occurs between the colon and the bladder. Fistulas can be corrected with a colon resection and removal of the fistula.
                
Intestinal obstruction. Diverticulitis-related inflammation or scarring caused by past inflammation may lead to intestinal obstruction. If the intestine is completely blocked, emergency surgery is necessary, with possible colon resection. Partial blockage is not an emergency, so the surgery or other procedures to correct it can be scheduled.
                
When urgent surgery with colon resection is necessary for diverticulitis, two procedures may be needed because it is not safe to rejoin the colon right away. During the colon resection, the surgeon performs a temporary colostomy, creating an opening, or stoma, in the abdomen. The end of the colon is connected to the opening to allow normal eating while healing occurs. Stool is collected in a pouch attached to the stoma on the abdominal wall. In the second surgery, several months later, the surgeon rejoins the ends of the colon and closes the stoma.";;0.0;412.0;1.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;-0.049;-0.503;-0.764;-0.213

Gilbert syndrome typically doesn't require treatment or pose serious complications. In fact, Gilbert syndrome is usually not considered a disease because of its benign nature. Many individuals find out they have the disorder by accident, when they have a blood test that shows elevated bilirubin levels. More males than females have been diagnosed with Gilbert syndrome.

Nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia due to hexokinase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that a mutation in both copies of the gene associated with the condition must be present in order to be affected. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each have one mutated copy of the gene in each cell and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not have any signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of the same autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to be affected, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be an unaffected carrier like each parent, and a 25% risk to be unaffected and have 2 normal copies of the gene.;;0.0;123.0;1.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.074;-0.346;-0.637;-0.018

18;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is Hydrocephalus due to congenital stenosis of aqueduct of sylvius inherited ?;"Is hydrocephalus due to congenital stenosis of aqueduct of sylvius inherited? Hydrocephalus due to congenital stenosis of aqueduct of sylvius is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. A condition is X-linked if the responsible gene is located on the X chromosome. The X chromosome is one of the two sex chromosomes (the other sex chromosome is the Y chromosome). Females have two X chromosomes in each cell and males have an X chromosome and a Y chromosome in each cell. Although females have two X chromosomes, one of the X chromosomes in each cell is ""turned off"" and all of the genes on that chromosome are inactivated. Females who have a change (mutation) in a gene on one of their X chromosomes are called carriers of the related condition. Carrier females usually do not have symptoms of the condition because the X chromosome with the mutated gene is often turned off and they have another X chromosome with a working copy of the gene. Sometimes, the X chromosome with the working copy of the gene is turned off, which may cause symptoms of the condition. However, females with symptoms are usually much more mildly affected than males. A male has only one X chromosome, so if he inherits a mutation on the X chromosome, he will have signs and symptoms (be affected). Males with an X-linked recessive condition always pass the mutated gene to all of their daughters, who will be carriers. A male cannot pass an X-linked gene to his sons because males always pass their Y chromosome to male offspring. Female carriers of an X-linked recessive condition have a 25% chance with each pregnancy to have a carrier daughter like themselves, a 25% chance to have a non-carrier daughter, a 25% chance to have an affected son, and a 25% chance to have an unaffected son. This also means that each daughter of a carrier mother has a 50% chance of being a carrier, and each son has a 50% chance of having the condition.";;0.0;292.0;1.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.034;-0.403;-0.701;-0.066

The goals of treatment are to cure the infection and prevent complications.
                
General Treatment
                
If you have pneumonia, follow your treatment plan, take all medicines as prescribed, and get ongoing medical care. Ask your doctor when you should schedule followup care. Your doctor may want you to have a chest x ray to make sure the pneumonia is gone.
                
Although you may start feeling better after a few days or weeks, fatigue (tiredness) can persist for up to a month or more. People who are treated in the hospital may need at least 3 weeks before they can go back to their normal routines.
                
Bacterial Pneumonia
                
Bacterial pneumonia is treated with medicines called antibiotics. You should take antibiotics as your doctor prescribes. You may start to feel better before you finish the medicine, but you should continue taking it as prescribed. If you stop too soon, the pneumonia may come back.
                
Most people begin to improve after 1 to 3 days of antibiotic treatment. This means that they should feel better and have fewer symptoms, such as cough and fever.
                
Viral Pneumonia
                
Antibiotics don't work when the cause of pneumonia is a virus. If you have viral pneumonia, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medicine to treat it.
                
Viral pneumonia usually improves in 1 to 3 weeks.
                
Treating Severe Symptoms
                
You may need to be treated in a hospital if:
                
Your symptoms are severe
                
You're at risk for complications because of other health problems

22;gemini-pro;treatment;What are the treatments for Schwannomatosis ?;How might schwannomatosis be treated? Treatment for schwannomatosis is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example, pain is one of the most common symptoms of the condition. Treatment with medications such as gabapentin or pregabalin and the use of short-acting opioids and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories for pain can be successful for many patients. If pain cannot be managed with other means or if the schwannomas are causing other symptoms, they can be surgically removed. However this treatment is often used as a last resort because surgery may put patients at risk of further neurologic problems.;Schwannomatosis, a rare genetic condition characterized by multiple schwannomas, benign nerve sheath tumors, affecting various nerves throughout the body, presents several treatment options. Surgery remains the primary intervention for symptomatic schwannomas causing pain, neurological deficits, or functional impairment. Microsurgical techniques aim to remove the tumor while preserving nerve function. Radiation therapy, such as stereotactic radiosurgery or fractionated radiotherapy, may be considered for inoperable or recurrent tumors to shrink their size and alleviate symptoms. Medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or opioids may help manage pain.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.;Westphal disease, also known as progressive supranuclear palsy, is a rare neurological disorder that affects movement, balance, and eye control.

24;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Arachnoid Cysts ?;"Arachnoid cysts are cerebrospinal fluid-filled sacs that are located between the brain or spinal cord and the arachnoid membrane, one of the three membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. Primary arachnoid cysts are present at birth and are the result of developmental abnormalities in the brain and spinal cord that arise during the early weeks of gestation. Secondary arachnoid cysts are not as common as primary cysts and develop as a result of head injury, meningitis, or tumors, or as a complication of brain surgery. The majority of arachnoid cysts form outside the temporal lobe of the brain in an area of the skull known as the middle cranial fossa. Arachnoid cysts involving the spinal cord are rarer. The location and size of the cyst determine the symptoms and when those symptoms begin. Most individuals with arachnoid cysts develop symptoms before the age of 20, and especially during the first year of life, but some people with arachnoid cysts never have symptoms. Males are four times more likely to have arachnoid cysts than females.
                
Typical symptoms of an arachnoid cyst around the brain include headache, nausea and vomiting, seizures, hearing and visual disturbances, vertigo, and difficulties with balance and walking. Arachnoid cysts around the spinal cord compress the spinal cord or nerve roots and cause symptoms such as progressive back and leg pain and tingling or numbness in the legs or arms. Diagnosis usually involves a brain scan or spine scan using diffusion-weighted MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) which helps distinguish fluid-filled arachnoid cysts from other types of cysts.";Arachnoid cysts are fluid-filled sacs that develop between the arachnoid mater and pia mater, the two innermost layers of the meninges, the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. They can occur anywhere in the central nervous system, but are most commonly found in the middle cranial fossa, a region at the base of the skull. Arachnoid cysts are usually congenital, meaning they are present at birth, but they can also develop later in life due to trauma, infection, or bleeding. Most arachnoid cysts are asymptomatic, but some can cause symptoms such as headaches, seizures, cognitive problems, and visual disturbances. Treatment for arachnoid cysts typically involves surgical removal or aspiration of the fluid, but observation may be recommended for asymptomatic cysts.;0.045;233.0;111.0;0.351;0.121;0.246;0.87;0.224;0.161;0.287

Specially trained educators may perform a diagnostic educational evaluation assessing the child's academic and intellectual potential and level of academic performance. Once the evaluation is complete, the basic approach is to teach learning skills by building on the child's abilities and strengths while correcting and compensating for disabilities and weaknesses. Other professionals such as speech and language therapists also may be involved. Some medications may be effective in helping the child learn by enhancing attention and concentration. Psychological therapies may also be used.;"Treatment for learning disabilities typically involves a multidisciplinary approach, involving collaboration among various professionals such as special education teachers, psychologists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, and medical professionals. Specific treatments may include:

- **Individualized Education Programs (IEPs)**: These are tailored plans that outline specific accommodations and support services for students with learning disabilities in school settings.

- **Remedial Education**: This involves providing specialized instruction and support to help individuals with learning disabilities overcome specific academic challenges and improve their skills in areas such as reading, writing, and math.

- **Assistive Technology**: The use of technology can provide support and accommodations for individuals with learning disabilities, such as assistive listening devices, computer-aided instruction, speech-to-text software, and adaptive software.

- **Behavioral and Social Skills Training**: This can help individuals with learning disabilities develop coping strategies, self-regulation skills, and appropriate social behaviors to navigate challenges in their daily lives.

- **Speech and Language Therapy**: This can address difficulties with communication, articulation, and language comprehension.

- **Occupational Therapy**: This can assist with fine motor skills, sensory processing issues, and daily living skills.

- **Medication**: In some cases, medication may be prescribed to address co-occurring conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or anxiety, which can impact an individual's ability to learn.";0.03;86.0;197.0;0.261;0.069;0.185;0.752;0.021;0.113;-0.071
26;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Cancer ?;Cancer begins in your cells, which are the building blocks of your body. Normally, your body forms new cells as you need them, replacing old cells that die. Sometimes this process goes wrong. New cells grow even when you don't need them, and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor. Tumors can be benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer while malignant ones are. Cells from malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues. They can also break away and spread to other parts of the body.     Cancer is not just one disease but many diseases. There are more than 100 different types of cancer. Most cancers are named for where they start. For example, lung cancer starts in the lung, and breast cancer starts in the breast. The spread of cancer from one part of the body to another is called metastasis. Symptoms and treatment depend on the cancer type and how advanced it is. Most treatment plans may include surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy. Some may involve hormone therapy, biologic therapy, or stem cell transplantation.     NIH: National Cancer Institute;Cancer is a complex disease characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells in the body. These abnormal cells can arise from mutations in genes that control cell growth, proliferation, and death, leading to the formation of tumors. Cancer can affect various parts of the body, including organs, tissues, and blood. It can be categorized into different types based on the type of cell in which it originates, such as carcinoma (cancer of epithelial cells), sarcoma (cancer of connective tissue cells), leukemia (cancer of blood cells), and lymphoma (cancer of lymphoid tissue cells). Cancer treatment depends on the specific type and stage of the disease and may involve surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and hormone therapy.

30;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to familial dilated cardiomyopathy ?;"Mutations in more than 30 genes have been found to cause familial dilated cardiomyopathy. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are found in cardiac muscle cells called cardiomyocytes.  Many of these proteins play important roles in the contraction of the cardiac muscle through their association with cell structures called sarcomeres. Sarcomeres are the basic units of muscle contraction; they are made of proteins that generate the mechanical force needed for muscles to contract. Many other proteins associated with familial dilated cardiomyopathy make up the structural framework (the cytoskeleton) of cardiomyocytes. The remaining proteins play various roles within cardiomyocytes to ensure their proper functioning.  Mutations in one gene, TTN, account for approximately 20 percent of cases of familial dilated cardiomyopathy. The TTN gene provides instructions for making a protein called titin, which is found in the sarcomeres of many types of muscle cells, including cardiomyocytes. Titin has several functions within sarcomeres. One of its most important jobs is to provide structure, flexibility, and stability to these cell structures. Titin also plays a role in chemical signaling and in assembling new sarcomeres. The TTN gene mutations that cause familial dilated cardiomyopathy result in the production of an abnormally short titin protein. It is unclear how the altered protein causes familial dilated cardiomyopathy, but it is likely that it impairs sarcomere function and disrupts chemical signaling.  It is unclear how mutations in the other genes cause familial dilated cardiomyopathy. It is likely that the changes impair cardiomyocyte function and reduce the ability of these cells to contract, weakening and thinning cardiac muscle.  People with familial dilated cardiomyopathy often do not have an identified mutation in any of the known associated genes. The cause of the condition in these individuals is unknown.  Familial dilated cardiomyopathy is described as nonsyndromic or isolated because it typically affects only the heart. However, dilated cardiomyopathy can also occur as part of syndromes that affect other organs and tissues in the body. These forms of the condition are described as syndromic and are caused by mutations in other genes. Additionally, there are many nongenetic causes of dilated cardiomyopathy, including viral infection and chronic alcohol abuse.";Familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a genetic condition characterized by the enlargement and weakening of the heart muscle. Genetic changes associated with familial DCM can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked manner. Mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in sarcomere structure and function, such as MYH7, TNNT2, and ACTC, are commonly implicated. These mutations can lead to abnormal heart muscle contraction and relaxation, resulting in the progressive enlargement and weakening of the heart over time. Additionally, mutations in genes involved in nuclear envelope structure and function, such as LMNA and EMD, have also been associated with familial DCM. These genetic changes can disrupt the integrity of the nuclear envelope, leading to abnormal gene expression and impaired cellular function in the heart.;0.006;333.0;116.0;0.289;0.032;0.123;0.694;-0.044;-0.088;-0.003

33;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to aromatase deficiency ?;Mutations in the CYP19A1 gene cause aromatase deficiency. The CYP19A1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aromatase. This enzyme converts a class of hormones called androgens, which are involved in male sexual development, to different forms of estrogen. In females, estrogen guides female sexual development before birth and during puberty. In both males and females, estrogen plays a role in regulating bone growth and blood sugar levels. During fetal development, aromatase converts androgens to estrogens in the placenta, which is the link between the mother's blood supply and the fetus. This conversion in the placenta prevents androgens from directing sexual development in female fetuses. After birth, the conversion of androgens to estrogens takes place in multiple tissues.  CYP19A1 gene mutations that cause aromatase deficiency decrease or eliminate aromatase activity. A shortage of functional aromatase results in an inability to convert androgens to estrogens before birth and throughout life. As a result, there is a decrease in estrogen production and an increase in the levels of androgens, including testosterone. In affected individuals, these abnormal hormone levels lead to impaired female sexual development, unusual bone growth, insulin resistance, and other signs and symptoms of aromatase deficiency. In women who are pregnant with an affected fetus, excess androgens in the placenta pass into the woman's bloodstream, which may cause her to have temporary signs and symptoms of aromatase deficiency.;Aromatase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that affects the conversion of androgens to estrogens. This conversion is catalyzed by the enzyme aromatase, which is encoded by the CYP19A1 gene. Mutations in this gene can lead to a deficiency of aromatase, resulting in low levels of estrogens and high levels of androgens. In males, this can cause undervirilization, gynecomastia, and infertility. In females, it can cause primary amenorrhea, infertility, and osteoporosis.

35;gemini-pro;exams and tests;How to diagnose Paget's Disease of Bone ?;"An Underdiagnosed Disease Experts believe that Paget's disease is underdiagnosed; people with a mild case and no symptoms may never know they have the disease. Or, they may receive a diagnosis by accident when x-rays or other laboratory tests done for another reason reveal Paget's disease. When symptoms do occur, they usually appear gradually and, in the early stages, may be confused with those of arthritis or other medical problems. Sometimes a person may not receive a clear diagnosis until the disease progresses and complications develop. Diagnostic Tests X-rays are almost always used to diagnose Paget's disease, but the disease may be discovered using one of three tests: - x-rays  -  an alkaline phosphatase blood test  -  or a bone scan. x-rays an alkaline phosphatase blood test or a bone scan. Bones affected by Paget's disease have a distinctive appearance on x-rays, which may show increased bone density, an abnormal bone structure, bowing, and enlargement. X-rays of leg bones may show very tiny fractures called microfractures. The enzyme alkaline phosphatase is involved in the normal growth of new bone. Having higher-than-normal levels of this chemical in the blood, however, may be a sign of Paget's disease. The alkaline phosphatase blood test measures the level of this substance. A bone scan provides a picture of the affected bones that doctors can use to see how far the disease has progressed. If a bone scan done for another reason suggests Paget's disease, the doctor can order x-rays to confirm the diagnosis. If the Disease Runs in the Family Early diagnosis and treatment of Paget's disease is important. Because Paget's disease can be hereditary, some experts recommend that the brothers, sisters, and children of anyone with the disease talk to their doctor about having an alkaline phosphatase blood test every 2 to 3 years after about age 40.";Paget's disease of bone, a chronic metabolic disorder affecting the bone remodeling process, can be diagnosed through a combination of clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, imaging studies, and sometimes a bone biopsy. Clinical evaluation involves assessing symptoms, such as bone pain, deformity, or fractures, and conducting a physical examination to look for signs of the disease. Laboratory tests may include blood tests to measure alkaline phosphatase levels, serum calcium and phosphorus levels, and urine tests to detect elevated levels of hydroxyproline, a marker of bone resorption. Imaging studies, such as X-rays, bone scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can reveal characteristic abnormalities in bone structure and metabolism. In some cases, a bone biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions with similar symptoms.;0.01;269.0;118.0;0.259;0.058;0.179;0.757;-0.036;-0.075;-0.0

Anti-thyroid medications, such as methimazole or propylthiouracil, are commonly used to suppress thyroid hormone production. Radioactive iodine therapy is another option, where a small dose of radioactive iodine is administered to selectively destroy thyroid cells and reduce hormone output. In severe cases, or when other treatments fail, surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid gland (thyroidectomy) may be necessary. Additionally, beta-blockers can be used to manage symptoms like rapid heart rate and tremors.

When the condition is caused by the UGT1A1*28 change in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene, it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have the mutation. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.  When the condition is caused by a missense mutation in the UGT1A1 gene, it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. A more severe condition known as Crigler-Najjar syndrome occurs when both copies of the UGT1A1 gene have mutations.;Gilbert syndrome is an inherited disorder that affects the metabolism of bilirubin, a yellow pigment produced during the breakdown of red blood cells. It is characterized by mild, chronic hyperbilirubinemia, which is a condition in which the level of bilirubin in the blood is higher than normal. Gilbert syndrome is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that only one copy of the affected gene is needed to cause the condition. The gene responsible for Gilbert syndrome is located on chromosome 2 and encodes an enzyme called bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1). Mutations in this gene can lead to a decreased ability to convert bilirubin into a form that can be excreted from the body, resulting in the accumulation of bilirubin in the blood.;0.07;111.0;108.0;0.356;0.107;0.281;0.72;0.002;0.088;-0.085

An estimated 14.4 million people live in these areas of high rates of infection. Another 15.2 live in areas where 20–40% of people report that they have had eye worm in the past.
    
More on: Where Loa Loa is Prevelant [WHO Map]
    
The people most at risk for loiasis are those who live in the certain rain forests in West and Central Africa. The deerflies that pass the parasite to humans usually bite during the day and are more common during the rainy season. They are attracted by the movement of people and by smoke from wood fires. Rubber plantations are areas where more deerflies may be found. The flies do not typically enter homes, but they might be attracted to homes that are well lit.
    
Travelers are more likely to become infected if they are in areas where they are bitten by deerflies for many months, though occasionally they get infected even if they are in an affected area for less than 30 days.
    
Your risk of infection depends on the number of bites received, the number of infected deerflies in the area you visit, and the length of your stay in the area.";Individuals residing in central and western Africa are at risk of contracting loiasis, a parasitic infection transmitted by the bite of an infected deerfly. Factors increasing the risk include spending extended periods in forested areas, engaging in outdoor activities near water bodies, and having limited access to preventive measures like insecticide-treated bed nets and insect repellent. Additionally, individuals with weakened immune systems or those who frequently travel to or reside in endemic regions are also at an increased risk of infection.;0.006;221.0;76.0;0.197;0.039;0.104;0.851;-0.024;-0.072;0.021
41;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome ?;Mutations in the GLI3 gene cause Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome. The GLI3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that controls gene expression, which is a process that regulates whether genes are turned on or off in particular cells. By interacting with certain genes at specific times during development, the GLI3 protein plays a role in the normal shaping (patterning) of many organs and tissues before birth.  Different genetic changes involving the GLI3 gene can cause Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome. In some cases, the condition results from a chromosomal abnormalitysuch as a large deletion or rearrangement of genetic materialin the region of chromosome 7 that contains the GLI3 gene. In other cases, a mutation in the GLI3 gene itself is responsible for the disorder. Each of these genetic changes prevents one copy of the gene in each cell from producing any functional protein. It remains unclear how a reduced amount of this protein disrupts early development and causes the characteristic features of Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome.;Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, polydactyly (extra fingers or toes), and developmental delays. The genetic changes associated with GCPS are mutations in the GLI3 gene, which encodes a protein involved in embryonic development. These mutations can be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that only one copy of the mutated gene is needed to cause the disorder. In some cases, GCPS can also occur as a result of a de novo mutation, which means that the mutation occurs spontaneously in an individual with no family history of the disorder.;0.041;144.0;87.0;0.364;0.092;0.23;0.722;0.024;0.035;0.01
42;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker Disease ?;Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease (GSS) is an extremely rare, neurodegenerative brain disorder. It is almost always inherited and is found in only a few families around the world. Onset of the disease usually occurs between the ages of 35 and 55. In the early stages, patients may experience varying levels of ataxia (lack of muscle coordination), including clumsiness, unsteadiness, and difficulty walking. As the disease progresses, the ataxia becomes more pronounced and most patients develop dementia. Other symptoms may include dysarthria (slurring of speech), nystagmus (involuntary movements of the eyes), spasticity (rigid muscle tone), and visual disturbances, sometimes leading to blindness. Deafness also can occur. In some families, parkinsonian features are present. GSS belongs to a family of human and animal diseases known as the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). Other TSEs include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, kuru, and fatal familial insomnia.;Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker Disease (GSS) is an extremely rare inherited prion disease characterized by a rapidly progressive dementia, accompanied by speech and movement difficulties. It is caused by mutations in the PRNP gene, leading to the accumulation of abnormal prion proteins in the brain. Symptoms typically appear in adulthood, with affected individuals experiencing cognitive decline, memory loss, changes in personality and behavior, difficulty with speech and language, and impaired coordination. GSS is relentlessly progressive, and there is currently no effective treatment or cure.;0.049;126.0;76.0;0.247;0.071;0.156;0.805;0.106;-0.021;0.236
43;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is Mosaic trisomy 9 inherited ?;"Is mosaic trisomy 9  inherited? Mosaic trisomy 9 is usually not inherited. It often occurs sporadically as a random event during the formation of the reproductive cells (egg and sperm) or as the fertilized egg divides. In rare cases, mosaic trisomy 9 may be inherited from a parent with a chromosomal rearrangement called a ""pericentric inversion."" This occurs when a segment of chromosome 9 has broken off in two places, swiveled round 180 degrees and reinserted itself into the chromosome. In these cases, the parent has a ""balanced"" rearrangement, meaning the piece of chromosome is in a different order but no genetic material is gained or lost. Carriers of a balanced rearrangement typically to not have any symptoms or health problems. However, they may be at an increased risk of having children with an abnormal number or chromosomes.";Mosaic trisomy 9 is not inherited. It occurs sporadically due to an error in cell division during early embryonic development. This results in some cells having an extra copy of chromosome 9, while others have the normal two copies. As a result, individuals with mosaic trisomy 9 may have a mix of normal and abnormal cells in their body. The proportion of abnormal cells can vary among individuals, and this can affect the severity of the condition. Mosaic trisomy 9 is a rare genetic disorder, and it is not passed down from parents to children.;0.074;122.0;86.0;0.392;0.094;0.252;0.901;0.135;0.052;0.219
44;gemini-pro;complications;What are the complications of Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome ?;"The complications of childhood nephrotic syndrome may include
                
- infection. When the kidneys are damaged, a child is more likely to develop infections because the body loses proteins that normally protect against infection. Health care providers will prescribe medications to treat infections. Children with childhood nephrotic syndrome should receive the pneumococcal vaccine and yearly flu shots to prevent those infections. Children should also receive age-appropriate vaccinations, although a health care provider may delay certain live vaccines while a child is taking certain medications.  - blood clots. Blood clots can block the flow of blood and oxygen through a blood vessel anywhere in the body. A child is more likely to develop clots when he or she loses proteins through the urine. The health care provider will treat blood clots with blood-thinning medications.  - high blood cholesterol. When albumin leaks into the urine, the albumin levels in the blood drop. The liver makes more albumin to make up for the low levels in the blood. At the same time, the liver makes more cholesterol. Sometimes children may need treatment with medications to lower blood cholesterol levels.";Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome (CNS) is a kidney disorder characterized by heavy proteinuria, edema, and hypoalbuminemia. Complications of CNS can be diverse and range from mild to life-threatening. They include an increased risk of infections due to impaired immune function, growth retardation due to protein loss and malnutrition, thromboembolic events due to hypercoagulability, and electrolyte imbalances. Additionally, long-term use of corticosteroids, a mainstay of CNS treatment, can lead to side effects such as hypertension, diabetes, cataracts, and osteoporosis. In severe cases, CNS can progress to end-stage renal disease, necessitating dialysis or kidney transplantation. Early diagnosis, prompt initiation of therapy, and regular monitoring are crucial to minimize the risk of complications and improve outcomes in children with CNS.;0.016;161.0;112.0;0.194;0.033;0.137;0.567;-0.143;-0.119;-0.17

It is likely that there are many factors that contribute to the development of this condition. These factors may include blood vessel abnormalities, tobacco use, hormone levels, and genetic predispositions. Approximately 28 percent of affected individuals have more than one artery with fibromuscular dysplasia. It is not known why some people develop this condition in more than one artery.;The exact cause of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) remains unknown, but several factors are believed to contribute to its development. Genetic predisposition, hormonal influences, and structural abnormalities in the affected arteries may play a role. FMD is often associated with other conditions, such as hypertension, migraine headaches, and Raynaud's phenomenon, suggesting a possible link between these conditions and the underlying mechanisms causing FMD. Additionally, certain environmental factors, such as smoking and high levels of stress, have been suggested to potentially increase the risk of developing FMD.;0.048;68.0;79.0;0.362;0.058;0.207;0.716;0.188;0.26;0.115

Marden-Walker syndrome is thought to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner since cases of affected siblings and parental consanguinity (the parents of the child with the condition are related to each other) have been reported.;Marden-Walker syndrome is typically not inherited, meaning it is not passed down from parents to children through genes. Instead, it is caused by a spontaneous genetic change, also known as a de novo mutation, that occurs during the formation of sperm or eggs in one of the parents. This means that each affected individual has a unique genetic change that is not present in their parents. In rare cases, Marden-Walker syndrome can be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, which means that both parents must carry the same genetic mutation for the condition to manifest in their child. However, this form of inheritance is extremely rare.;0.075;36.0;98.0;0.351;0.112;0.247;0.887;0.095;0.196;-0.004

50;gemini-pro;prevention;How to prevent Parasites - Taeniasis ?;"One way to prevent taeniasis is to cook meat to safe temperatures. A food thermometer should be used to measure the internal temperature of cooked meat. Do not sample meat until it is cooked. USDA recommends the following for meat preparation.
   
    - For Whole Cuts of Meat (excluding poultry) 
     
      - Cook to at least 145° F (63° C) as measured with a food thermometer placed in the thickest part of the meat, then allow the meat to rest* for three minutes before carving or consuming.
     
    - For Ground Meat (excluding poultry) 
     
      - Cook to at least 160° F (71° C); ground meats do not require a rest* time.
     
   
   
*According to USDA, ""A 'rest time' is the amount of time the product remains at the final temperature, after it has been removed from a grill, oven, or other heat source. During the three minutes after meat is removed from the heat source, its temperature remains constant or continues to rise, which destroys pathogens.""

Signs and symptoms of subacute cerebellar degeneration, include ataxia, speech and swallowing problems, dementia (in about half of people with this condition), and difficulty walking. People with subacute cerebellar degeneration due to thiamine deficiency may also experience quick involuntary movements of the eyeball (nystagmus), double-vision, dizziness, and paralysis of the eye muscles. In paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting may precede the neurological symptoms. Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration may occur in association with Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome or encephalomyelitis.;Subacute cerebellar degeneration, a rare neurological disorder, primarily affects the cerebellum, a region of the brain responsible for coordination and balance. Its symptoms typically evolve over weeks to months. The most common initial symptom is gait disturbance, characterized by unsteadiness, wide-based gait, and frequent falls. As the disease progresses, additional symptoms may appear, including slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, impaired eye movements, tremors, muscle weakness, and cognitive changes such as memory problems and emotional disturbances. Patients may also experience vision problems, including double vision and blurred vision.

52;gemini-pro;information;Do you have information about Blood Thinners;Summary : If you have some kinds of heart or blood vessel disease, or if you have poor blood flow to your brain, your doctor may recommend that you take a blood thinner. Blood thinners reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke by reducing the formation of blood clots in your arteries and veins. You may also take a blood thinner if you have       - An abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation    - Heart valve surgery    - Congenital heart defects       There are two main types of blood thinners. Anticoagulants, such as heparin or warfarin (also called Coumadin), work on chemical reactions in your body to lengthen the time it takes to form a blood clot. Antiplatelet drugs, such as aspirin, prevent blood cells called platelets from clumping together to form a clot.    When you take a blood thinner, follow directions carefully. Make sure that your healthcare provider knows all of the medicines and supplements you are using.;Blood thinners, also known as anticoagulants, are medications that prevent or reduce blood clotting. They are commonly used to treat or prevent conditions associated with an increased risk of blood clots, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), atrial fibrillation, and certain types of heart valve replacements. Blood thinners work by interfering with the body's natural clotting process, making it less likely for clots to form or grow. Different types of blood thinners are available, and the choice of medication depends on the specific condition being treated and the individual's personal medical history and preferences. Blood thinners can be taken orally, injected, or administered intravenously, and regular monitoring of blood clotting time (INR) may be necessary to ensure the medication is working effectively and to minimize the risk of complications such as excessive bleeding.;0.046;144.0;129.0;0.311;0.081;0.156;0.818;0.054;0.023;0.082

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Four types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery     Treatment of GI carcinoid tumors usually includes surgery. One of the following surgical procedures may be used:             -  Endoscopic resection: Surgery to remove a small tumor that is on the inside lining of the GI tract. An endoscope is inserted through the mouth and passed through the esophagus to the stomach and sometimes, the duodenum. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light, a lens for viewing, and a tool for removing tumor tissue.     -  Local excision: Surgery to remove the tumor and a small amount of normal tissue around it.      -  Resection: Surgery to remove part or all of the organ that contains cancer. Nearby lymph nodes may also be removed.     -  Cryosurgery: A treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy carcinoid tumor tissue. This type of treatment is also called cryotherapy. The doctor may use ultrasound to guide the instrument.      -  Radiofrequency ablation: The use of a special probe with tiny electrodes that release high-energy radio waves (similar to microwaves) that kill cancer cells. The probe may be inserted through the skin or through an incision (cut) in the abdomen.     -  Liver transplant: Surgery to remove the whole liver and replace it with a healthy donated liver.     -  Hepatic artery embolization: A procedure to embolize (block) the hepatic artery, which is the main blood vessel that brings blood into the liver. Blocking the flow of blood to the liver helps kill cancer cells growing there.               Radiation therapy      Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.            Radiopharmaceutical therapy is a type of internal radiation therapy. Radiation is given to the tumor using a drug that has a radioactive substance, such as iodine I 131, attached to it. The radioactive substance kills the tumor cells.     External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors that have spread to other parts of the body.        Chemotherapy      Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).      Chemoembolization of the hepatic artery is a type of regional chemotherapy that may be used to treat a gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor that has spread to the liver. The anticancer drug is injected into the hepatic artery through a catheter (thin tube). The drug is mixed with a substance that embolizes (blocks) the artery, and cuts off blood flow to the tumor. Most of the anticancer drug is trapped near the tumor and only a small amount of the drug reaches other parts of the body. The blockage may be temporary or permanent, depending on the substance used to block the artery. The tumor is prevented from getting the oxygen and nutrients it needs to grow. The liver continues to receive blood from the hepatic portal vein, which carries blood from the stomach and intestine.     The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.       Hormone therapy      Hormone therapy with a somatostatin analogue is a treatment that stops extra hormones from being made. GI carcinoid tumors are treated with octreotide or lanreotide which are injected under the skin or into the muscle. Octreotide and lanreotide may also have a small effect on stopping tumor growth.
                
                
                    Treatment for carcinoid syndrome may also be needed.
                    Treatment of carcinoid syndrome may include the following:          - Hormone therapy with a somatostatin analogue stops extra hormones from being made. Carcinoid syndrome is treated with octreotide or lanreotide to lessen flushing and diarrhea. Octreotide and lanreotide may also help slow tumor growth.     -  Interferon therapy stimulates the bodys immune system to work better and lessens flushing and diarrhea. Interferon may also help slow tumor growth.    - Taking medicine for diarrhea.    - Taking medicine for skin rashes.    - Taking medicine to breathe easier.    - Taking medicine before having anesthesia for a medical procedure.        Other ways to help treat carcinoid syndrome include avoiding things that cause flushing or difficulty breathing such as alcohol, nuts, certain cheeses and foods with capsaicin, such as chili peppers. Avoiding stressful situations and certain types of physical activity can also help treat carcinoid syndrome.   For some patients with carcinoid heart syndrome, a heart valve replacement may be done.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Targeted therapy      Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Several types of targeted therapy are being studied in the treatment of GI carcinoid tumors.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

56;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to atopic dermatitis ?;"The genetics of atopic dermatitis are not completely understood. Studies suggest that several genes can be involved in development of the condition. The strongest association is with the FLG gene, which is mutated in 20 to 30 percent of people with atopic dermatitis compared with 8 to 10 percent of the general population without atopic dermatitis.  The FLG gene provides instructions for making a protein called profilaggrin, which is cut (cleaved) to produce multiple copies of the filaggrin protein. Filaggrin is involved in creating the structure of the outermost layer of skin, creating a strong barrier to keep in water and keep out foreign substances, including toxins, bacteria, and substances that can cause allergic reactions (allergens), such as pollen and dust. Further processing of the filaggrin protein produces other molecules that are part of the skin's ""natural moisturizing factor,"" which helps maintain hydration of the outermost layer of skin.  Mutations in the FLG gene lead to production of an abnormally short profilaggrin molecule that cannot be cleaved to produce filaggrin proteins. The resulting shortage of filaggrin can impair the barrier function of the skin. In addition, a lack of natural moisturizing factor allows excess water loss through the skin, which can lead to dry skin.  Research shows that impairment of the skin's barrier function contributes to development of allergic disorders. An allergic reaction occurs when the body mistakenly recognizes a harmless substance, such as pollen, as a danger and stimulates an immune response to it. Research suggests that without a properly functioning barrier, allergens are able to get into the body through the skin. For unknown reasons, in susceptible individuals the body reacts as if the allergen is harmful and produces immune proteins called IgE antibodies specific to the allergen. Upon later encounters with the allergen, IgE antibodies recognize it, which stimulates an immune response, causing the symptoms of allergies, such as itchy, watery eyes or breathing difficulty. Although atopic dermatitis is not initially caused by an allergic reaction, flare-ups of the rashes can be triggered by allergens. The impaired barrier function caused by FLG gene mutations also contributes to the increased risk of asthma and other allergic disorders in people with atopic dermatitis.  Mutations in many other genes, most of which have not been identified, are likely associated with development of atopic dermatitis. Researchers suspect these genes are involved in the skin's barrier function or in the function of the immune system. However, not everyone with a mutation in FLG or another associated gene develops atopic dermatitis; exposure to certain environmental factors also contributes to the development of the disorder. Studies suggest that these exposures trigger epigenetic changes to the DNA. Epigenetic changes modify DNA without changing the DNA sequence. They can affect gene activity and regulate the production of proteins, which may influence the development of allergies in susceptible individuals.";In atopic dermatitis (AD), genetic alterations affect skin barrier function, immune response, and inflammation. Key genetic changes include mutations in filaggrin, a protein crucial for skin barrier integrity, leading to increased susceptibility to allergens and irritants. Additionally, variations in genes involved in immune regulation, such as those encoding thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), interleukin-4 (IL-4), and interleukin-13 (IL-13), contribute to the exaggerated immune responses characteristic of AD. Furthermore, genetic variants in genes associated with skin barrier repair, like cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) and sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1 (SMPD1), impact the skin's ability to effectively repair and maintain its integrity.;0.001;422.0;94.0;0.198;0.04;0.125;0.766;-0.163;-0.194;-0.136
57;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is congenital myasthenic syndrome inherited ?;This condition is most commonly inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.  Rarely, this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.;Congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) is a group of rare genetic disorders that affect the neuromuscular junction, the point at which nerve cells connect to muscles. In most cases, CMS is inherited, meaning it is passed down from parents to children through genes.

60;gemini-pro;causes;What causes Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, vascular type ?;What causes Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, vascular type? Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), vascular type is caused by changes (mutations) in the COL3A1 gene. The COL3A1 gene provides instructions for making a component of type III collagen. Collagen is a protein that provides structure and strength to connective tissues throughout the body. Type III collagen, specifically, is found in tissues such as the skin, lungs, intestinal walls, and the walls of blood vessels. Mutations in the COL3A1 gene lead to defects in type III collagen molecules and/or reduced amounts of functional type III collagen. This causes the many signs and symptoms associated with EDS, vascular type.;Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, vascular type (EDS-VASC) is a rare inherited connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in the COL3A1 gene, which encodes the pro-alpha1 chain of type III collagen. This genetic defect leads to the production of structurally abnormal type III collagen, a major component of blood vessel walls, skin, and internal organs. The abnormal collagen disrupts the integrity and strength of these structures, resulting in the clinical manifestations of EDS-VASC, including fragile blood vessels prone to rupture, easy bruising, characteristic facial features, joint hypermobility, and risk of organ complications such as bowel perforation and arterial dissections.;0.132;93.0;88.0;0.413;0.196;0.302;0.831;0.226;0.266;0.184

Genetic testing, particularly chromosomal microarray analysis or whole-exome sequencing, can identify genetic variants associated with the syndrome. Imaging studies, such as brain MRI, may reveal structural abnormalities in the brain and spinal cord. Additional supportive tests may include ophthalmological examination for eye abnormalities, echocardiography for heart evaluation, and audiological assessment for hearing problems.

Autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's tissues and organs.  A small percentage of all cases of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy have been reported to run in families; however, the condition does not have a clear pattern of inheritance.

The exact cause of IIM is unknown, but it is thought to be triggered by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. While some cases of IIM may have a genetic component, the majority of cases are considered sporadic, meaning they occur without a clear familial pattern. Currently, there is no definitive evidence to suggest that IIM is directly inherited in a Mendelian manner, and the genetic factors involved are likely complex and involve multiple genes. Ongoing research aims to elucidate the genetic basis of IIM and identify specific genetic markers associated with the disease.;0.051;107.0;106.0;0.333;0.082;0.173;0.781;0.136;0.15;0.119
67;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Gillespie syndrome ?;Gillespie syndrome is a disorder that involves eye abnormalities, problems with balance and coordinating movements (ataxia), and mild to moderate intellectual disability.  Gillespie syndrome is characterized by aniridia, which is the absence of the colored part of the eye (the iris). In most affected individuals, only part of the iris is missing (partial aniridia) in both eyes, but in some affected individuals, partial aniridia affects only one eye, or the entire iris is missing (complete aniridia) in one or both eyes. The absence of all or part of the iris can cause blurry vision (reduced visual acuity) and increased sensitivity to light (photophobia). Rapid, involuntary eye movements (nystagmus) can also occur in Gillespie syndrome.  The balance and movement problems in Gillespie syndrome result from underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of a part of the brain called the cerebellum. This abnormality can cause delayed development of motor skills such as walking. In addition, difficulty controlling the muscles in the mouth can lead to delayed speech development. The difficulties with coordination generally become noticeable in early childhood when the individual is learning these skills. People with Gillespie syndrome usually continue to have an unsteady gait and speech problems. However, the problems do not get worse over time, and in some cases they improve slightly.  Other features of Gillespie syndrome can include abnormalities in the bones of the spine (vertebrae) and malformations of the heart.;Gillespie syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by distinctive facial features, intellectual disability, and delayed development. It is caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called fibrillin-1. Fibrillin-1 is a key component of microfibrils, which are tiny structures that provide strength and support to connective tissues throughout the body, particularly in the skin, eyes, and heart. Individuals with Gillespie syndrome may have distinctive facial features, including a long, narrow face, a prominent forehead, widely spaced eyes, and a pointed chin. They may also have intellectual disability, delayed development, and problems with speech and language. Skin and cardiovascular complications can also occur. Treatment for Gillespie syndrome is supportive and may include therapies to address the specific symptoms and complications of the condition.;0.024;207.0;118.0;0.296;0.061;0.148;0.796;0.021;-0.039;0.08

70;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) X-linked sideroblastic anemia ?;X-linked sideroblastic anemia is an inherited disorder that prevents developing red blood cells (erythroblasts) from making enough hemoglobin, which is the protein that carries oxygen in the blood. People with X-linked sideroblastic anemia have mature red blood cells that are smaller than normal (microcytic) and appear pale (hypochromic) because of the shortage of hemoglobin. This disorder also leads to an abnormal accumulation of iron in red blood cells. The iron-loaded erythroblasts, which are present in bone marrow, are called ring sideroblasts. These abnormal cells give the condition its name.  The signs and symptoms of X-linked sideroblastic anemia result from a combination of reduced hemoglobin and an overload of iron. They range from mild to severe and most often appear in young adulthood. Common features include fatigue, dizziness, a rapid heartbeat, pale skin, and an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). Over time, severe medical problems such as heart disease and liver damage (cirrhosis) can result from the buildup of excess iron in these organs.;X-linked sideroblastic anemia (XLSA) is a rare, genetic blood disorder characterized by defective heme synthesis in developing red blood cells. This leads to the accumulation of iron in the mitochondria of developing red blood cells. XLSA affects males almost exclusively and is passed down from generation to generation through the X chromosome. Symptoms of XLSA can vary depending on the severity of the condition and may include fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and pale skin. Treatment for XLSA typically involves blood transfusions, iron chelation therapy, and measures to manage the underlying cause of the anemia. Bone marrow transplantation is occasionally considered in severe cases.;0.058;150.0;96.0;0.335;0.113;0.24;0.789;0.068;0.035;0.1
71;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa ?;NARP results from mutations in the MT-ATP6 gene. This gene is contained in mitochondrial DNA, also known as mtDNA. Mitochondria are structures within cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the nucleus, mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA.  The MT-ATP6 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is essential for normal mitochondrial function. Through a series of chemical reactions, mitochondria use oxygen and simple sugars to create adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main energy source. The MT-ATP6 protein forms one part (subunit) of an enzyme called ATP synthase, which is responsible for the last step in ATP production. Mutations in the MT-ATP6 gene alter the structure or function of ATP synthase, reducing the ability of mitochondria to make ATP. It remains unclear how this disruption in mitochondrial energy production leads to muscle weakness, vision loss, and the other specific features of NARP.;The genetic changes associated with neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP) are typically caused by mutations in the mitochondrial gene MT-ATP6. These mutations result in a defective subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase enzyme, leading to decreased cellular energy production and accumulation of abnormal mitochondrial DNA. This can lead to various clinical manifestations, including peripheral neuropathy (sensory and motor dysfunction in the limbs), ataxia (impaired balance and coordination), and retinitis pigmentosa (a degenerative disorder of the eye). Other genetic changes associated with NARP include mutations in the mitochondrial genes MT-ND1, MT-ND4, and MT-ND6, as well as mutations in nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial function or biogenesis.;0.016;146.0;98.0;0.286;0.062;0.161;0.71;0.029;0.01;0.045
72;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) succinate-CoA ligase deficiency ?;Succinate-CoA ligase deficiency is an inherited disorder that affects the early development of the brain and other body systems. One of the earliest signs of the disorder is very weak muscle tone (severe hypotonia), which appears in the first few months of life. Severe hypotonia delays the development of motor skills such as holding up the head and rolling over. Many affected children also have muscle weakness and reduced muscle mass, which prevents them from standing and walking independently.  Additional features of succinate-CoA ligase deficiency can include progressive abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis or kyphosis), uncontrolled movements (dystonia), severe hearing loss, and seizures beginning in childhood. In most affected children, a substance called methylmalonic acid builds up abnormally in the body and is excreted in urine (methylmalonic aciduria). Most children with succinate-CoA ligase deficiency also experience a failure to thrive, which means that they gain weight and grow more slowly than expected.  Succinate-CoA ligase deficiency causes breathing difficulties that often lead to recurrent infections of the respiratory tract. These infections can be life-threatening, and most people with succinate-CoA ligase deficiency live only into childhood or adolescence.  A few individuals with succinate-CoA ligase deficiency have had an even more severe form of the disorder known as fatal infantile lactic acidosis. Affected infants develop a toxic buildup of lactic acid in the body (lactic acidosis) in the first day of life, which leads to muscle weakness and breathing difficulties. Children with fatal infantile lactic acidosis usually live only a few days after birth.;Succinate-CoA ligase deficiency is a rare inherited metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme succinate-CoA ligase (also known as succinyl-CoA synthetase), which plays a crucial role in the Krebs (citric acid) cycle within mitochondria. This enzyme deficiency impairs the conversion of succinate to succinyl-CoA, leading to a buildup of succinate and a decrease in cellular energy production. Succinate-CoA ligase deficiency typically manifests in infancy with symptoms such as poor feeding, failure to thrive, developmental delay, muscle weakness, and metabolic acidosis. Treatment options include dietary modifications, enzyme replacement therapy, and supportive care to manage the symptoms and prevent complications.;0.017;232.0;91.0;0.238;0.069;0.158;0.779;0.029;-0.047;0.105
73;gemini-pro;causes;What causes Osteoarthritis ?;Osteoarthritis often results from years of wear and tear on joints. This wear and tear mostly affects the cartilage, the tissue that cushions the ends of bones within the joint. Osteoarthritis occurs when the cartilage begins to fray, wear away, and decay. Putting too much stress on a joint that has been repeatedly injured may lead to the development of osteoarthritis, too. A person who is overweight is more likely to develop osteoarthritis because of too much stress on the joints. Also, improper joint alignment may lead to the development of osteoarthritis.;Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of cartilage and bone within the joints. The exact cause of osteoarthritis is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of factors, including age, genetics, obesity, joint injury, and muscle weakness. Age is the biggest risk factor for osteoarthritis, as the cartilage in the joints naturally wears down over time. Genetics also plays a role, as some people are more likely to develop osteoarthritis if they have a family history of the condition. Obesity puts extra stress on the joints, which can lead to osteoarthritis. Joint injuries can also damage the cartilage and lead to osteoarthritis. Muscle weakness can also contribute to osteoarthritis, as weak muscles cannot properly support the joints.;0.064;82.0;111.0;0.258;0.093;0.21;0.753;0.291;0.323;0.258

In milder cases, dietary changes and avoiding medications that require P450 metabolism may be sufficient. In more severe cases, medications or treatments that increase P450 activity or bypass the need for P450 enzymes may be necessary. Additionally, supportive care, such as blood transfusions or antibiotics, may be required to manage complications. In some cases, liver transplantation may be considered for individuals with severe and life-threatening complications. Ongoing research is exploring novel therapies, including gene therapy and enzyme replacement therapy, to address the underlying cause of the deficiency.

Individuals with Maffucci syndrome may benefit from consultations with the following specialists: Radiologist: Radiography or CT scanning performed periodically to evaluate bone changes. Orthopedic surgeon: An orthopedic surgeon may be consulted to evaluate bone changes and skeletal neoplasms and to help in treatment of fractures associated with the disease. Dermatologist: A dermatologist may be consulted to evaluate hemangiomas associated with the condition and to identify any new lesions on the skin.;Maffucci syndrome, characterized by multiple enchondromas and hemangiomas, often requires a multidisciplinary approach to management. Treatment options may include surgical excision of symptomatic or enlarging enchondromas, embolization for problematic hemangiomas, pain management with medications or interventional techniques, genetic counseling, and regular monitoring for complications such as malignant transformation or spinal cord compression. In cases of severe hemangiomas, systemic therapies like propranolol or corticosteroids may be considered. Additionally, supportive care measures such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, and psychological support can improve the overall well-being and quality of life of individuals with Maffucci syndrome.;0.044;82.0;91.0;0.224;0.051;0.144;0.775;0.014;0.039;-0.013

77;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is Pilocytic astrocytoma inherited ?;"Are pilocytic astrocytomas inherited? Pilocytic astrocytomas are typically sporadic, occurring by chance in individuals with no history of the condition in the family. Sporadic abnormalities are not inherited from a parent and are not likely to recur in a family. Familial cases of isolated astrocytomas are very rare. Although most individuals with a pilocytic astrocytoma do not have an underlying genetic condition, astrocytomas have been associated with a few ""predisposing"" genetic syndromes. Individuals with these syndromes will not necessarily develop one; these tumors just occur with a greater frequency in affected individuals. Genetic syndromes in which astrocytomas have been reported to occur include: neurofibromatosis type 1 Turcot syndrome Li-Fraumeni syndrome tuberous sclerosis All of these genetic conditions follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Individuals who are interested in learning about personal genetic risks for these conditions and/or genetic testing options for themselves or family members should speak with a genetics professional.";Pilocytic astrocytoma, the most common childhood brain tumor, is rarely inherited. Most cases occur sporadically, with no clear genetic cause. However, a small percentage of cases, approximately 5-10%, have been associated with inherited genetic mutations, such as germline mutations in the NF1 gene. These genetic alterations can predispose individuals to developing pilocytic astrocytomas, particularly those that occur in association with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), an inherited condition characterized by the growth of non-cancerous tumors along nerves.;0.029;142.0;71.0;0.331;0.089;0.221;0.749;0.085;0.042;0.126

The diagnosis of succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency is based upon a thorough clinical exam, the identification of features consistent with the condition, and a variety of specialized tests. SSADH deficiency may first be suspected in late infancy or early childhood in individuals who have encephalopathy, a state in which brain function or structure is altered. The encephalopathy may be characterized by cognitive impairment; language deficit; poor muscle tone (hypotonia); seizures; decreased reflexes (hyporeflexia); and/or difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia). The diagnosis may be further suspected if urine organic acid analysis (a test that provides information about the substances the body discards through the urine) shows the presence of 4-hydroxybutyric acid. The diagnosis can be confirmed by an enzyme test showing deficiency of SSADH, or by genetic testing. ALDH5A1 is the only gene currently known to be associated with SSADH deficiency, and genetic testing can detect mutations in about 97% of affected individuals.";"Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency is a rare inherited disorder characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH). Diagnosis of this condition typically involves several steps:

1. **Medical History and Symptoms**: A thorough medical history is taken to gather information about the individual's symptoms, such as seizures, developmental delays, movement disorders, and other neurological issues.

2. **Physical Examination**: A physical examination is performed to assess the individual's overall health, neurological status, and any physical signs or abnormalities associated with SSADH deficiency.

3. **Biochemical Testing**: Blood and urine tests are conducted to measure the levels of succinic semialdehyde and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the body. Elevated levels of these substances may indicate a deficiency of SSADH.

4. **Molecular Genetic Testing**: Genetic testing is performed to identify mutations in the ALDH5A1 gene, which encodes the SSADH enzyme. This testing can confirm the diagnosis of SSADH deficiency and determine the specific genetic variant responsible for the condition.

5. **Imaging Studies**: In some cases, brain imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans, may be performed to evaluate the structural abnormalities or brain damage associated with SSADH deficiency.";0.083;143.0;175.0;0.367;0.131;0.164;0.93;0.173;0.188;0.156

Hypokalemic periodic paralysis involves attacks of muscle weakness or loss of muscle movement (paralysis) that come and go. The weakness or paralysis is most commonly located in the shoulders and hips, affecting the muscles of the arms and legs. Muscles of the eyes and those that help you breathe and swallow may also be affected. There is normal muscle strength between attacks.  Attacks usually begin in adolescence, but they can occur before age 10. How often the attacks occur varies. Some people have attacks every day, while others have them once a year. Episodes of muscle weakness usually last between a few hours and a day. Attacks can occur without warning or can be triggered by factors such as rest after exercise, a viral illness, or certain medications. Often, a large, carbohydrate-rich meal, alcohol, or vigorous exercise in the evening can trigger an attack upon waking the following morning. Although affected individuals usually regain their muscle strength between attacks, repeated episodes can lead to persistent muscle weakness later in life. People with hypokalemic periodic paralysis have reduced levels of potassium in their blood (hypokalemia) during episodes of muscle weakness. Researchers are investigating how low potassium levels may be related to the muscle abnormalities in this condition.

92;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is osteogenesis imperfecta inherited ?;"Most cases of osteogenesis imperfecta have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. Many people with type I or type IV osteogenesis imperfecta inherit a mutation from a parent who has the disorder. Most infants with more severe forms of osteogenesis imperfecta (such as type II and type III) have no history of the condition in their family. In these infants, the condition is caused by new (sporadic) mutations in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene.  Less commonly, osteogenesis imperfecta has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Autosomal recessive inheritance means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder typically are not affected, but each carry one copy of the altered gene. Some cases of osteogenesis imperfecta type III are autosomal recessive; these cases usually result from mutations in genes other than COL1A1 and COL1A2. When osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by mutations in the CRTAP or P3H1 gene, the condition also has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.";Yes, osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is primarily inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, meaning that one copy of the defective gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Approximately 85% of cases result from mutations in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes, which provide instructions for making the two chains of type I collagen, a major structural component of bone. Additionally, autosomal recessive OI is caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in collagen formation, modification, or function.

Most children with growth failure grow to about one-third of their adult height within the first two years of life; therefore, it is important to start treatment for growth failure early.1";In children with chronic kidney disease (CKD), growth failure can be addressed through various interventions. Nutritional support is crucial, including a high-calorie, high-protein diet along with phosphate binders and vitamin D supplements. Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) therapy is commonly prescribed to stimulate growth and improve body composition. Calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, helps regulate calcium and phosphate metabolism, promoting bone growth. Erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) are administered to manage anemia, which can hinder growth.

94;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to androgenetic alopecia ?;A variety of genetic and environmental factors likely play a role in causing androgenetic alopecia. Although researchers are studying risk factors that may contribute to this condition, most of these factors remain unknown. Researchers have determined that this form of hair loss is related to hormones called androgens, particularly an androgen called dihydrotestosterone. Androgens are important for normal male sexual development before birth and during puberty. Androgens also have other important functions in both males and females, such as regulating hair growth and sex drive.  Hair growth begins under the skin in structures called follicles. Each strand of hair normally grows for 2 to 6 years, goes into a resting phase for several months, and then falls out. The cycle starts over when the follicle begins growing a new hair. Increased levels of androgens in hair follicles can lead to a shorter cycle of hair growth and the growth of shorter and thinner strands of hair. Additionally, there is a delay in the growth of new hair to replace strands that are shed.  Although researchers suspect that several genes play a role in androgenetic alopecia, variations in only one gene, AR, have been confirmed in scientific studies. The AR gene provides instructions for making a protein called an androgen receptor. Androgen receptors allow the body to respond appropriately to dihydrotestosterone and other androgens. Studies suggest that variations in the AR gene lead to increased activity of androgen receptors in hair follicles. It remains unclear, however, how these genetic changes increase the risk of hair loss in men and women with androgenetic alopecia.  Researchers continue to investigate the connection between androgenetic alopecia and other medical conditions, such as coronary heart disease and prostate cancer in men and polycystic ovary syndrome in women. They believe that some of these disorders may be associated with elevated androgen levels, which may help explain why they tend to occur with androgen-related hair loss. Other hormonal, environmental, and genetic factors that have not been identified also may be involved.;Androgenetic alopecia, also known as male-pattern baldness, is a common condition characterized by hair loss in men. It is caused by a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors. The genetic changes associated with androgenetic alopecia involve variations in several genes, including the androgen receptor gene (AR), the aromatase gene (CYP19A1), and the 5α-reductase genes (SRD5A1 and SRD5A2). These genes are involved in the regulation of androgen production, metabolism, and signaling, which play a role in hair growth and follicle development. Mutations or polymorphisms in these genes can lead to increased androgen sensitivity, altered hair follicle cycling, and ultimately, hair loss. Additionally, genetic variations in other genes, such as those involved in inflammation and immune responses, have also been implicated in the development of androgenetic alopecia.;0.019;313.0;117.0;0.369;0.122;0.164;0.842;0.075;0.026;0.122

Surface irregularities and unorganized chalk deposits with light areas in the middle of the tumor and cartilage cap may be seen on a bone scan, ultrasound or preferably an MRI. However the diagnosis of chondrosarcoma can only be confirmed by a bone biopsy. What are the signs and symptoms of malignant transformation in hereditary multiple exostoses (HME)? A doctor may become suspicious of a malignant transformation if there is an increase in the size of the tumor in adults when bone growth is already complete. In addition, cancer should be suspected if the thickness of the cartilaginous cap of the osteochondroma is over 1-2 centimeters (normally, after bone growth is complete, the cap is only a few millimeters thick). Other signs of a malignant transformation may include bone pain, temporary loss of sensory or motor function due to compression of a nerve (neurapraxia) or pressure related symptoms in nearby organs. Is screening recommended for malignant transformation in hereditary multiple exostoses (HME)? At present, medical researchers agree that more studies need to be performed to determine the best screening protocols for those with HME, including the study of benefit/cost/risk. However a compelling study was published in 2014 by Czajka and DiCaprio which compares the screening of malignant transformation in people with HME to the screening of breast and cervical cancer in women. The authors conclude that screening should be offered to individuals with HME over the age of 16 (or when bone growth has been completed). They propose screening should include a thorough clinical examination and a full body MRI every two years. If an MRI is not possible than a bone scan be performed, followed by an ultrasound of the cartilage cap of any suspicious findings. The Czajka and DiCaprio further recommend that individuals with HME should be made aware of warning signs of malignant transformation and taught self examination techniques.";Hereditary multiple osteochondromas, also known as hereditary multiple exostoses, is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of multiple benign bone tumors (osteochondromas) on the long bones of the body, particularly around the knees, shoulders, and ankles. Diagnosis typically begins with a physical examination, where the healthcare provider feels for hard bumps or bony growths around the joints. X-rays are commonly used to confirm the diagnosis, revealing the characteristic features of osteochondromas, such as their attachment to the bone and the presence of a cartilage cap. Genetic testing may also be performed to identify specific gene mutations associated with the condition. Additional imaging techniques, like MRI or CT scans, may be utilized to further assess the extent and location of the osteochondromas.;0.004;394.0;106.0;0.223;0.046;0.118;0.793;-0.085;-0.215;0.048

Gene Therapy Research for Salivary Gland Dysfunction Scientists at NIHs National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) are exploring the potential use of gene therapy to treat salivary gland dysfunction. The idea is to transfer additional or replacement genes into the salivary glands of people with Sjgren's syndrome and cancer patients whose salivary glands were damaged during radiation treatment. The hope is that these genes will increase the production of saliva and eliminate the chronic parched sensation that bothers people with dry mouth conditions. NIDCR recently completed a clinical study, a research study in humans, on gene therapy for radiation-damaged salivary glands. The study showed that gene therapy can be safely performed in salivary glands and that it has the potential to help head and neck cancer survivors with dry mouth. Read NIDCRs news release  to learn more about the studys findings. Based on the promising results of this trial, similar clinical trials are planned in the near future. Research on Sjgrens Syndrome and Other Diseases Affecting Salivary Glands NIDCR is also conducting clinical trials to study new approaches for improving salivary flow in patients with Sjogrens syndrome. Such studies include testing the effectiveness of a monoclonal antibody as well as a corticosteroid to see whether either of these treatments helps improve salivary flow. Other studies are focused on learning how diseases such as diabetes, auto inflammatory diseases, and granulomatous diseases cause salivary gland dysfunction. Such studies could one day lead to better ways of preventing and treating salivary gland conditions.

In acquired pili torti, treatment involves stopping the exposure to the causative agent (e.g., to oral retinoids) or condition (e.g., improving diet). There is no specific treatment for the inherited form of pili torti. It may improve spontaneously after puberty. If pili torti is detected, further evaluation to investigate possible neurological disorders, problems with hair, teeth or nails (ectodermal disturbances) and hearing loss is mandatory. It is generally recommended that people with pili torti try to avoid trauma to the hair. Suggestions include, sleeping on a satin pillowcase, avoiding excessive grooming, braiding, heat treatments, dying and coloring, reducing exposure to sunlight (wear a hat), using gentle shampoos diluted in warm water, adding conditioner to freshly washed hair, avoiding use of a hair dryer (or using it on cool setting), and avoiding oral retinoids (e.g., isotretinoin, acitretin) if possible. Some individuals with pili torti choose to wear a wig.;Pili torti, a rare hair shaft abnormality, often does not require treatment, as it is usually asymptomatic. In cases where there is significant hair breakage or cosmetic concerns, there are a few treatment options.

Spondylothoracic dysostosis is caused by changes (mutations) in the MESP2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person and may include surgery for bone malformations and respiratory support.";Spondylothoracic dysostosis is an extremely rare genetic disorder characterized by distinctive skeletal abnormalities in the spine, ribcage, and hands. The primary features include a severely curved spine with vertebral malformations, a broad ribcage with widely spaced ribs, and unusually broad or mitten-shaped thumbs. Other potential manifestations may involve the neck, shoulders, pelvis, and extremities. This condition is caused by mutations in the DLL3 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that both parents must carry the defective gene for the disorder to be expressed in a child. Early diagnosis and comprehensive medical care are crucial for managing the associated complications and improving overall quality of life.;0.097;106.0;97.0;0.31;0.115;0.232;0.86;0.178;0.156;0.198
100;gemini-pro;exams and tests;How to diagnose Parasites - Paragonimiasis (also known as Paragonimus Infection) ?;"The infection is usually diagnosed by identification of Paragonimus eggs in sputum. The eggs are sometimes found in stool samples (coughed-up eggs are swallowed). A tissue biopsy is sometimes performed to look for eggs in a tissue specimen.
    
Specific and sensitive antibody tests based on P. westermani antigens are available through CDC, and serologic tests using a variety of techniques are available through commercial laboratories.

More on: DPDx: Paragonimus";Paragonimiasis, also known as Paragonimus infection, is diagnosed through a combination of medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Symptoms typically include chronic cough, chest pain, and hemoptysis (coughing up blood). During a physical examination, your doctor may listen to your lungs for abnormal sounds and check for any abnormalities in the chest area. Laboratory tests may involve examining sputum or stool samples for the presence of Paragonimus eggs or larvae. Blood tests can help detect antibodies against the parasite. Imaging studies, such as chest X-rays or computed tomography (CT) scans, may be used to visualize lesions or cysts caused by the parasite. Additionally, serological tests, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or Western blot, can be performed to detect antibodies specific to Paragonimus infection.;0.023;71.0;121.0;0.269;0.056;0.179;0.726;-0.023;0.007;-0.055
101;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly ?;Nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly is an abnormality of brain development that also affects the head and face. Normally, the brain divides into two halves (hemispheres) during early development. Holoprosencephaly occurs when the brain fails to divide properly into the right and left hemispheres. This condition is called nonsyndromic to distinguish it from other types of holoprosencephaly caused by genetic syndromes, chromosome abnormalities, or substances that cause birth defects (teratogens). The severity of nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly varies widely among affected individuals, even within the same family.  Nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly can be grouped into four types according to the degree of brain division. From most to least severe, the types are known as alobar, semi-lobar, lobar, and middle interhemispheric variant (MIHV). In the most severe forms of nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly, the brain does not divide at all. These affected individuals have one central eye (cyclopia) and a tubular nasal structure (proboscis) located above the eye. Most babies with severe nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly die before birth or soon after. In the less severe forms, the brain is partially divided and the eyes are usually set close together (hypotelorism). The life expectancy of these affected individuals varies depending on the severity of symptoms.  People with nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly often have a small head (microcephaly), although they can develop a buildup of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus) that causes increased head size (macrocephaly). Other features may include an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) with or without a split in the upper lip (cleft lip), one central front tooth instead of two (a single maxillary central incisor), and a flat nasal bridge. The eyeballs may be abnormally small (microphthalmia) or absent (anophthalmia).  Some individuals with nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly have a distinctive pattern of facial features, including a narrowing of the head at the temples, outside corners of the eyes that point upward (upslanting palpebral fissures), large ears, a short nose with upturned nostrils, and a broad and deep space between the nose and mouth (philtrum). In general, the severity of facial features is directly related to the severity of the brain abnormalities. However, individuals with mildly affected facial features can have severe brain abnormalities. Some people do not have apparent structural brain abnormalities but have some of the facial features associated with this condition. These individuals are considered to have a form of the disorder known as microform holoprosencephaly and are typically identified after the birth of a severely affected family member.  Most people with nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly have developmental delay and intellectual disability. Affected individuals also frequently have a malfunctioning pituitary gland, which is a gland located at the base of the brain that produces several hormones. Because pituitary dysfunction leads to the partial or complete absence of these hormones, it can cause a variety of disorders. Most commonly, people with nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly and pituitary dysfunction develop diabetes insipidus, a condition that disrupts the balance between fluid intake and urine excretion. Dysfunction in other parts of the brain can cause seizures, feeding difficulties, and problems regulating body temperature, heart rate, and breathing. The sense of smell may be diminished (hyposmia) or completely absent (anosmia) if the part of the brain that processes smells is underdeveloped or missing.;Nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly (HPE) is a rare congenital brain malformation characterized by the failure of the forebrain to divide into two hemispheres during embryonic development. This results in a single, midline ventricle and various degrees of facial abnormalities, ranging from mild to severe. The exact cause of nonsyndromic HPE is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treatment options for nonsyndromic HPE depend on the severity of the condition and may include surgery, medication, and supportive care.;0.0;470.0;77.0;0.205;0.04;0.122;0.71;-0.011;-0.168;0.153
102;gemini-pro;outlook;What is the outlook for Aphasia ?;The outcome of aphasia is difficult to predict given the wide range of variability of the condition. Generally, people who are younger or have less extensive brain damage fare better. The location of the injury is also important and is another clue to prognosis. In general, people tend to recover skills in language comprehension more completely than those skills involving expression.;The outlook for aphasia depends on the severity of the condition and the underlying cause. With intensive speech and language therapy, many people with aphasia can improve their communication skills. However, for some people, aphasia may be a permanent condition. The prognosis for aphasia is generally better if it is caused by a transient event such as a stroke, rather than a progressive condition such as dementia. With proper support and therapy, people with aphasia can learn to communicate in new ways and live fulfilling lives.;0.019;56.0;77.0;0.275;0.032;0.176;0.813;0.115;0.094;0.134
103;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Rhabdoid tumor ?;Rhabdoid tumor (RT) is an aggressive pediatric soft tissue sarcoma that arises in the kidney, the liver, the peripheral nerves and all miscellaneous soft-parts throughout the body. RT involving the central nervous system (CNS) is called atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor. RT usually occurs in infancy or childhood. In most cases, the first symptoms are linked to the compressive effects of a bulky tumor (such as respiratory distress, abdomen mass, peripheral nerve palsy). In about 90% of the cases it is caused by a mutation in the SMARCB1 gene, which is a tumor suppressor gene and in rare cases by a mutation in the SMARCA4 gene. No standard care exists for RT although there are a lot of studies. Treatment includes resection of the tumor mass and chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Because atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors and rhabdoid tumors of the kidney have the same gene mutation and similar biopsy findings they are considered now identical or closely related entities. Also, 10-15% of patients with malignant rhabdoid tumors have brain tumors.;"Rhabdoid tumor is a rare and aggressive type of cancer that can occur in children and infants. It is characterized by the presence of large, round cells with prominent nucleoli and a distinctive ""rhabdoid"" appearance. These tumors can arise in various parts of the body, including the kidneys, brain, and soft tissues. Rhabdoid tumors are often highly malignant and can spread rapidly to other organs. Treatment typically involves a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, but the prognosis for patients with rhabdoid tumors is often poor due to the aggressive nature of the disease.";0.013;150.0;86.0;0.282;0.044;0.172;0.768;0.131;0.027;0.236
104;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Age-related Macular Degeneration ?;Dry AMD occurs when the light-sensitive cells in the macula slowly break down, gradually blurring central vision in the affected eye. As dry AMD gets worse, you may see a blurred spot in the center of your vision. Over time, as less of the macula functions, central vision in the affected eye can be lost. If you have vision loss from dry AMD in one eye only, you may not notice any changes in your overall vision. With the other eye seeing clearly, you can still drive, read, and see fine details. You may notice changes in your vision only if AMD affects both eyes. If you experience blurry vision, see an eye care professional for a comprehensive dilated eye exam.;Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common eye condition that affects the macula, the central portion of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision. AMD is characterized by the deterioration of the macula, leading to a gradual loss of central vision, while peripheral vision remains unaffected. As the leading cause of vision loss in individuals over the age of 50, AMD can significantly impact daily activities like reading, driving, and recognizing faces. Early detection and management are crucial to preserve vision and prevent further deterioration.;0.016;111.0;76.0;0.228;0.035;0.146;0.678;0.07;0.043;0.094

Many diseases affecting humans can be traced to animals or animal products. You can get a disease directly from an animal, or indirectly, through the environment.    Farm animals can carry diseases. If you touch them or things they have touched, like fencing or buckets, wash your hands thoroughly. Adults should make sure children who visit farms or petting zoos wash up as well.     Though they may be cute and cuddly, wild animals may carry germs, viruses, and parasites. Deer and deer mice carry ticks that cause Lyme disease. Some wild animals may carry rabies. Enjoy wildlife from a distance.    Pets can also make you sick. Reptiles pose a particular risk. Turtles, snakes and iguanas can transmit Salmonella bacteria to their owners. You can get rabies from an infected dog or toxoplasmosis from handling kitty litter of an infected cat. The chance that your dog or cat will make you sick is small. You can reduce the risk by practicing good hygiene, keeping pet areas clean and keeping your pets' shots up-to-date.;Animal diseases, also known as zoonoses, are infections that can be transmitted from animals to humans. These diseases can cause a wide range of symptoms, from mild to severe, and can even be fatal. Some common animal diseases that can infect humans include rabies, influenza, and salmonella. Animal diseases can be spread through direct contact with an infected animal or its bodily fluids, or through indirect contact with contaminated objects or food. Protecting yourself from animal diseases involves avoiding contact with sick animals, practicing good hygiene, and consuming animal products that have been properly cooked or pasteurized. If you think you may have been exposed to an animal disease, it is important to seek medical attention promptly.;0.025;171.0;114.0;0.351;0.068;0.17;0.819;0.079;0.001;0.156

112;gemini-pro;treatment;What are the treatments for Varicose Veins ?;"Varicose veins are treated with lifestyle changes and medical procedures. The goals of treatment are to relieve symptoms, prevent complications, and improve appearance.
                
If varicose veins cause few symptoms, your doctor may simply suggest making lifestyle changes. If your symptoms are more severe, your doctor may recommend one or more medical procedures. For example, you may need a medical procedure if you have a lot of pain, blood clots, or skin disorders caused by your varicose veins.
                
Some people who have varicose veins choose to have procedures to improve how their veins look.
                
Although treatment can help existing varicose veins, it can't keep new varicose veins from forming.
                
Lifestyle Changes
                
Lifestyle changes often are the first treatment for varicose veins. These changes can prevent varicose veins from getting worse, reduce pain, and delay other varicose veins from forming. Lifestyle changes include the following:
                
Avoid standing or sitting for long periods without taking a break. When sitting, avoid crossing your legs. Keep your legs raised when sitting, resting, or sleeping. When you can, raise your legs above the level of your heart.
                
Do physical activities to get your legs moving and improve muscle tone. This helps blood move through your veins.
                
If you're overweight or obese, try to lose weight. This will improve blood flow and ease the pressure on your veins.
                
Avoid wearing tight clothes, especially those that are tight around your waist, groin (upper thighs), and legs. Tight clothes can make varicose veins worse.
                
Avoid wearing high heels for long periods. Lower heeled shoes can help tone your calf muscles. Toned muscles help blood move through the veins.
                
Your doctor may recommend compression stockings. These stockings create gentle pressure up the leg. This pressure keeps blood from pooling and decreases swelling in the legs.
                
There are three types of compression stockings. One type is support pantyhose. These offer the least amount of pressure. A second type is over-the-counter compression hose. These stockings give a little more pressure than support pantyhose. Over-the-counter compression hose are sold in medical supply stores and pharmacies.
                
Prescription-strength compression hose are the third type of compression stockings. These stockings offer the greatest amount of pressure. They also are sold in medical supply stores and pharmacies. However, you need to be fitted for them in the store by a specially trained person.
                
Medical Procedures
                
Medical procedures are done either to remove varicose veins or to close them. Removing or closing varicose veins usually doesn't cause problems with blood flow because the blood starts moving through other veins.
                
You may be treated with one or more of the procedures described below. Common side effects right after most of these procedures include bruising, swelling, skin discoloration, and slight pain.
                
The side effects are most severe with vein stripping and ligation (li-GA-shun). Rarely, this procedure can cause severe pain, infections, blood clots, and scarring.
                
Sclerotherapy
                
Sclerotherapy (SKLER-o-ther-ah-pe) uses a liquid chemical to close off a varicose vein. The chemical is injected into the vein to cause irritation and scarring inside the vein. The irritation and scarring cause the vein to close off, and it fades away.
                
This procedure often is used to treat smaller varicose veins and spider veins. It can be done in your doctor's office, while you stand. You may need several treatments to completely close off a vein.
                
Treatments typically are done every 4 to 6 weeks. Following treatments, your legs will be wrapped in elastic bandaging to help with healing and decrease swelling.
                
Microsclerotherapy
                
Microsclerotherapy (MI-kro-SKLER-o-ther-ah-pe) is used to treat spider veins and other very small varicose veins.
                
A small amount of liquid chemical is injected into a vein using a very fine needle. The chemical scars the inner lining of the vein, causing it to close off.
                
Laser Surgery
                
This procedure applies light energy from a laser onto a varicose vein. The laser light makes the vein fade away.
                
Laser surgery mostly is used to treat smaller varicose veins. No cutting or injection of chemicals is involved.
                
Endovenous Ablation Therapy
                
Endovenous ablation (ab-LA-shun) therapy uses lasers or radiowaves to create heat to close off a varicose vein.
                
Your doctor makes a tiny cut in your skin near the varicose vein. He or she then inserts a small tube called a catheter into the vein. A device at the tip of the tube heats up the inside of the vein and closes it off.
                
You'll be awake during this procedure, but your doctor will numb the area around the vein. You usually can go home the same day as the procedure.
                
Endoscopic Vein Surgery
                
For endoscopic (en-do-SKOP-ik) vein surgery, your doctor will make a small cut in your skin near a varicose vein. He or she then uses a tiny camera at the end of a thin tube to move through the vein. A surgical device at the end of the camera is used to close the vein.
                
Endoscopic vein surgery usually is used only in severe cases when varicose veins are causing skin ulcers (sores). After the procedure, you usually can return to your normal activities within a few weeks.
                
Ambulatory Phlebectomy
                
For ambulatory phlebectomy (fle-BEK-to-me), your doctor will make small cuts in your skin to remove small varicose veins. This procedure usually is done to remove the varicose veins closest to the surface of your skin.
                
You'll be awake during the procedure, but your doctor will numb the area around the vein. Usually, you can go home the same day that the procedure is done.
                
Vein Stripping and Ligation
                
Vein stripping and ligation typically is done only for severe cases of varicose veins. The procedure involves tying shut and removing the veins through small cuts in your skin.
                
You'll be given medicine to temporarily put you to sleep so you don't feel any pain during the procedure.
                
Vein stripping and ligation usually is done as an outpatient procedure. The recovery time from the procedure is about 1 to 4 weeks.";Varicose vein treatments range from conservative measures like compression stockings, lifestyle changes, and sclerotherapy, which involves injecting a solution into the vein to cause it to collapse, to more invasive procedures like endovenous laser ablation, radiofrequency ablation, and surgical vein stripping or ligation. The choice of treatment depends on the severity of the condition and the patient's individual preferences and health status.;0.0;908.0;56.0;0.142;0.029;0.089;0.688;-0.203;-0.347;-0.054

                    Osteosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of the bone are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells form in bone.
                    Osteosarcoma usually starts in osteoblasts, which are a type of bone cell that becomes new bone tissue. Osteosarcoma is most common in adolescents. It commonly forms in the ends of the long bones of the body, which include bones of the arms and legs. In children and adolescents, it often forms in the bones near the knee. Rarely, osteosarcoma may be found in soft tissue or organs in the chest or abdomen.   Osteosarcoma is the most common type of bone cancer. Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of bone is a rare tumor of the bone. It is treated like osteosarcoma.     Ewing sarcoma is another kind of bone cancer, but it is not covered in this summary. See the PDQ summary about Ewing Sarcoma Treatment for more information.";Osteosarcoma and Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma of Bone (MFH) are aggressive primary bone cancers that can occur at any age but are most common in children and young adults. Osteosarcoma typically arises in the long bones of the arms and legs, while MFH can occur in any bone in the body. Both tumors are characterized by the formation of malignant cells that produce bone or fibrous tissue, respectively, and can lead to pain, swelling, and decreased range of motion in the affected area. Treatment for both types of cancer typically involves surgery to remove the tumor, followed by chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy to eliminate any remaining cancer cells.;0.048;207.0;101.0;0.374;0.129;0.175;0.874;0.172;0.139;0.203

Specialists Involved
                
If you have varicose veins, you may see a vascular medicine specialist or vascular surgeon. These doctors specialize in blood vessel conditions. You also may see a dermatologist. This type of doctor specializes in skin conditions.
                
Physical Exam
                
To check for varicose veins in your legs, your doctor will look at your legs while you're standing or sitting with your legs dangling. He or she may ask you about your signs and symptoms, including any pain you're having.
                
Diagnostic Tests and Procedures
                
Duplex Ultrasound
                
Your doctor may recommend duplex ultrasound to check blood flow in your veins and to look for blood clots. Duplex ultrasound combines traditional with Doppler ultrasound. Traditional ultrasound uses sound waves to create apicture of the structures in your body, in this case the blood vessels and anything that may be blocking the flow of blood. Doppler ultrasound uses sound waves to create pictures of the flow or movement of the blood through theveins. The two types of ultrasound together paint a picture that helps your doctor diagnose your condition.
                
During this test, a handheld device will be placed on your body and passed back and forth over the affected area. The device sends and receives sound waves. A computer will convert the sound waves into a picture of the blood flow in your arteries and veins.
                
Angiogram
                
Although it is not very common, your doctor may recommend an angiogram to get a more detailed look at the blood flow through your veins.
                
For this procedure, dye is injected into your veins. The dye outlines your veins on x-ray images.
                
An angiogram can help your doctor confirm whether you have varicose veins or another condition.";Varicose veins are enlarged, twisted blood vessels that are commonly found in the legs. Diagnosis of varicose veins typically involves a physical examination and medical history review. During the physical exam, the healthcare provider will assess the appearance, texture, and location of the veins. They may also ask about symptoms such as pain, swelling, or itching in the affected area. Additionally, the provider may order imaging tests, such as an ultrasound, to evaluate the blood flow and identify any underlying abnormalities. In some cases, a blood test may be performed to check for underlying conditions that could be contributing to the development of varicose veins.;0.006;288.0;93.0;0.313;0.054;0.19;0.699;0.053;-0.069;0.178

An AUD can range in severity from mild to severe. On one end of this spectrum, drinking might cause sickness, depression, or sleeping problems. More severe symptoms include drinking more than intended or craving alcohol once youve stopped drinking. AUD can be a lifelong disease in which people have a strong need to drink, cannot control their drinking once they start, and over time need to drink greater and greater amounts of alcohol to get high. Older adults who develop a severe AUD become physically dependent on alcohol. When they stop drinking, they can get nauseated, sweaty, shaky, and restless. These withdrawal symptoms can cause them to start drinking again to feel better, even though doing so can lead to physical or psychological problems.  Learn more about alcohol use disorder.;"Alcohol Use and Older Adults:

As individuals age, their bodies undergo physiological changes that can impact the way alcohol is metabolized and its effects on the body. With advancing age, the body's water content decreases, leading to a higher concentration of alcohol in the blood. This can result in an increased risk of alcohol-related problems, even with moderate alcohol consumption. Additionally, older adults may be more susceptible to the negative effects of alcohol on various organs, including the brain, liver, and heart. Furthermore, certain medications commonly prescribed to older adults can interact with alcohol, potentially leading to adverse reactions. Therefore, it is crucial for older adults to be aware of the potential risks associated with alcohol consumption and to drink responsibly, if at all.";0.014;143.0;115.0;0.221;0.033;0.128;0.605;-0.04;-0.066;-0.017

124;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Tay-Sachs Disease ?;Tay-Sachs disease is a rare, inherited disorder. It causes too much of a fatty substance to build up in the brain. This buildup destroys nerve cells, causing mental and physical problems.    Infants with Tay-Sachs disease appear to develop normally for the first few months of life. Then mental and physical abilities decline. The child becomes blind, deaf, and unable to swallow. Muscles begin to waste away and paralysis sets in. Even with the best of care, children with Tay-Sachs disease usually die by age 4.    The cause is a gene mutation which is most common in Eastern European Ashkenazi Jews. To get the disease, both parents must have the gene. If they do, there is a 25% chance of the child having the disease. A blood test and prenatal tests can check for the gene or the disease.    There is no cure. Medicines and good nutrition can help some symptoms. Some children need feeding tubes.    NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke;Tay-Sachs disease is a rare inherited disorder that leads to the buildup of a fatty substance called ganglioside GM2 in the brain. This buildup causes progressive damage to nerve cells, which results in a decline in mental and physical abilities. Symptoms typically appear in infancy and include developmental delays, seizures, blindness, and paralysis.

125;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome ?;Mutations in the SLC16A2 gene cause Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome. The SLC16A2 gene, also known as MCT8, provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in the development of the nervous system. This protein transports a particular hormone into nerve cells in the developing brain. This hormone, called triiodothyronine or T3, is produced by a butterfly-shaped gland in the lower neck called the thyroid. T3 appears to be critical for the normal formation and growth of nerve cells, as well as the development of junctions between nerve cells (synapses) where cell-to-cell communication occurs. T3 and other forms of thyroid hormone also help regulate the development of other organs and control the rate of chemical reactions in the body (metabolism).  Gene mutations alter the structure and function of the SLC16A2 protein. As a result, this protein is unable to transport T3 into nerve cells effectively. A lack of this critical hormone in certain parts of the brain disrupts normal brain development, resulting in intellectual disability and problems with movement. Because T3 is not taken up by nerve cells, excess amounts of this hormone continue to circulate in the bloodstream. Increased T3 levels in the blood may be toxic to some organs and contribute to the signs and symptoms of Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome.;Allan-Herndon-Dudley (AHD) syndrome, also known as Mental retardation, X-linked 6, is a rare genetic condition mainly characterized by intellectual disability. It is caused by mutations in the SLC6A8 gene, which encodes a neuronal transporter responsible for transporting creatine and gamma-aminobutyric acid. These mutations lead to reduced creatine transport into the brain, resulting in insufficient energy production and impaired neurotransmission. The genetic changes associated with AHD syndrome include missense mutations, nonsense mutations, and splicing defects within the SLC6A8 gene, leading to a loss of function or impaired function of the creatine transporter.;0.011;187.0;83.0;0.272;0.048;0.213;0.615;0.042;-0.031;0.114
126;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to Sotos syndrome ?;Mutations in the NSD1 gene are the primary cause of Sotos syndrome, accounting for up to 90 percent of cases. Other genetic causes of this condition have not been identified.  The NSD1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that functions as a histone methyltransferase. Histone methyltransferases are enzymes that modify structural proteins called histones, which attach (bind) to DNA and give chromosomes their shape. By adding a molecule called a methyl group to histones (a process called methylation), histone methyltransferases regulate the activity of certain genes and can turn them on and off as needed. The NSD1 protein controls the activity of genes involved in normal growth and development, although most of these genes have not been identified.  Genetic changes involving the NSD1 gene prevent one copy of the gene from producing any functional protein. Research suggests that a reduced amount of NSD1 protein disrupts the normal activity of genes involved in growth and development. However, it remains unclear exactly how a shortage of this protein during development leads to overgrowth, learning disabilities, and the other features of Sotos syndrome.;Sotos syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by excessive growth and distinct facial features, is primarily caused by mutations in the NSD1 gene. Located on chromosome 5, NSD1 provides instructions for producing a protein essential for gene regulation and cellular development. Mutations in NSD1 disrupt the protein's function, leading to abnormal growth and developmental patterns observed in Sotos syndrome. These mutations can be inherited from either parent or may occur spontaneously. Identifying these genetic changes is crucial for accurate diagnosis and genetic counseling, helping families understand the risks of recurrence and plan for appropriate medical care.;0.029;164.0;91.0;0.291;0.069;0.174;0.792;0.096;0.04;0.15

Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene to be affected. The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not have signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier.;Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter (LVW) is a rare, progressive neurological disorder characterized by the degeneration of white matter in the brain. The exact cause of LVW is unknown, but it is believed to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. In some cases, LVW is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning that both parents must carry the defective gene for the child to inherit the disorder. In other cases, LVW is caused by de novo mutations, which are spontaneous changes in the DNA that occur for the first time in an individual. Environmental factors, such as exposure to toxins or infections, may also play a role in the development of LVW.;0.104;106.0;102.0;0.379;0.107;0.288;0.783;0.02;0.057;-0.019

134;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Fanconi Anemia ?;"Fanconi anemia (fan-KO-nee uh-NEE-me-uh), or FA, is a rare, inherited blood disorder that leads to bone marrow failure. The disorder also is called Fanconis anemia.
                
FA prevents your bone marrow from making enough new blood cells for your body to work normally. FA also can cause your bone marrow to make many faulty blood cells. This can lead to serious health problems, such as leukemia (a type of blood cancer).
                
Although FA is a blood disorder, it also can affect many of your body's organs, tissues, and systems. Children who inherit FA are at higher risk of being born with birth defects. FA also increases the risk of some cancers and other serious health problems.
                
FA is different from Fanconi syndrome. Fanconi syndrome affects the kidneys. It's a rare and serious condition that mostly affects children.
                
Children who have Fanconi syndrome pass large amounts of key nutrients and chemicals through their urine. These children may have serious health and developmental problems.
                
Bone Marrow and Blood
                
Bone marrow is the spongy tissue inside the large bones of your body. Healthy bone marrow contains stem cells that develop into the three types of blood cells that the body needs:
                
Red blood cells, which carry oxygen to all parts of your body. Red blood cells also remove carbon dioxide (a waste product) from your body's cells and carry it to the lungs to be exhaled.
                
White blood cells, which help fight infections.
                
Platelets (PLATE-lets), which help your blood clot.
                
It's normal for blood cells to die. The lifespan of red blood cells is about 120 days. White blood cells live less than 1 day. Platelets live about 6 days. As a result, your bone marrow must constantly make new blood cells.
                
If your bone marrow can't make enough new blood cells to replace the ones that die, serious health problems can occur.
                
Fanconi Anemia and Your Body
                
FA is one of many types of anemia. The term ""anemia"" usually refers to a condition in which the blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells.
                
FA is a type of aplastic anemia. In aplastic anemia, the bone marrow stops making or doesn't make enough of all three types of blood cells. Low levels of the three types of blood cells can harm many of the body's organs, tissues, and systems.
                
With too few red blood cells, your body's tissues won't get enough oxygen to work well. With too few white blood cells, your body may have problems fighting infections. This can make you sick more often and make infections worse. With too few platelets, your blood cant clot normally. As a result, you may have bleeding problems.
                
Outlook
                
People who have FA have a greater risk than other people for some cancers. About 10percent of people who have FA develop leukemia.
                
People who have FA and survive to adulthood are much more likely than others to develop cancerous solid tumors.
                
The risk of solid tumors increases with age in people who have FA. These tumors can develop in the mouth, tongue, throat, or esophagus (eh-SOF-ah-gus). (The esophagus is the passage leading from the mouth to the stomach.)
                
Women who have FA are at much greater risk than other women of developing tumors in the reproductive organs.
                
FA is an unpredictable disease. The average lifespan for people who have FA is between 20 and 30 years. The most common causes of death related to FA are bone marrow failure, leukemia, and solid tumors.
                
Advances in care and treatment have improved the chances of surviving longer with FA. Blood and marrow stem cell transplant is the major advance in treatment. However, even with this treatment, the risk of some cancers is greater in people who have FA.";Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a rare, inherited blood disorder characterized by a failure of bone marrow to produce enough new blood cells. This results in anemia, an abnormally low red blood cell count, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and pale skin. Additionally, people with FA are at an increased risk of developing certain types of cancer, such as leukemia, and bone marrow failure. The disorder is caused by mutations in genes involved in DNA repair, making individuals more susceptible to DNA damage and genomic instability. Treatment for FA typically involves regular blood transfusions and stem cell transplantation, if a suitable donor is available. Genetic counseling and prenatal testing may also be recommended for families with a history of FA.;0.003;585.0;113.0;0.286;0.092;0.193;0.797;-0.057;-0.204;0.095

In this condition both red and green cone sensitivities are absent, however rod function and blue cone sensitivities are present. Signs and symptoms include severely reduced visual acuity (clearnes), eccentric fixation, infantile nystagmus that decreases with age, no obvious retinal abnormalities, and poor or no color discrimination.;Blue cone monochromatism, also known as tritanopia, is a rare genetic condition characterized by the absence or severe malfunction of the long-wavelength sensitive (L) cone cells in the retina. This results in an inability to perceive colors in the red-green spectrum, leading to difficulty differentiating between certain hues, particularly red and green. Individuals with blue cone monochromatism typically have normal vision in low-light conditions since the rod cells in the retina, which are responsible for black and white vision, are not affected. This condition affects approximately 1 in 10,000 males and is very rare in females.;0.039;55.0;88.0;0.265;0.075;0.177;0.772;0.076;0.085;0.064
136;gemini-pro;stages;What are the stages of Testicular Cancer ?;"Key Points
                    - After testicular cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the testicles or to other parts of the body.     - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.    - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.    - The following stages are used for testicular cancer:         - Stage 0 (Testicular Intraepithelial Neoplasia)     - Stage I     - Stage II     - Stage III
                
                
                    After testicular cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the testicles or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the testicles or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.    The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:         -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.     -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   Abdominal lymph node dissection : A surgical procedure in which lymph nodes in the abdomen are removed and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy. For patients with nonseminoma, removing the lymph nodes may help stop the spread of disease. Cancer cells in the lymph nodes of seminoma patients can be treated with radiation therapy.     -   Serum tumor marker test : A procedure in which a sample of blood is examined to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called tumor markers. The following 3 tumor markers are used in staging testicular cancer:               -  Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)      -  Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG).       -  Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).         Tumor marker levels are measured again, after inguinal orchiectomy and biopsy, in order to determine the stage of the cancer. This helps to show if all of the cancer has been removed or if more treatment is needed. Tumor marker levels are also measured during follow-up as a way of checking if the cancer has come back.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if testicular cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually testicular cancer cells. The disease is metastatic testicular cancer, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for testicular cancer:
                    Stage 0 (Testicular Intraepithelial Neoplasia)    In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the tiny tubules where the sperm cells begin to develop. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. All tumor marker levels are normal. Stage 0 is also called testicular intraepithelial neoplasia and testicular intratubular germ cell neoplasia.        Stage I    In stage I, cancer has formed. Stage I is divided into stage IA, stage IB, and stage IS and is determined after an inguinal orchiectomy is done.            - In stage IA, cancer is in the testicle and epididymis and may have spread to the inner layer of the membrane surrounding the testicle. All tumor marker levels are normal.     - In stage IB, cancer:                   -  is in the testicle and the epididymis and has spread to the blood vessels or lymph vessels in the testicle; or       - has spread to the outer layer of the membrane surrounding the testicle; or       - is in the spermatic cord or the scrotum and may be in the blood vessels or lymph vessels of the testicle.           All tumor marker levels are normal.     - In stage IS, cancer is found anywhere within the testicle, spermatic cord, or the scrotum and either:                  - all tumor marker levels are slightly above normal; or       - one or more tumor marker levels are moderately above normal or high.                          Stage II     Stage II is divided into stage IIA, stage IIB, and stage IIC and is determined after an inguinal orchiectomy is done.            - In stage IIA, cancer:                   - is anywhere within the testicle, spermatic cord, or scrotum; and       - has spread to up to 5 lymph nodes in the abdomen, none larger than 2 centimeters.           All tumor marker levels are normal or slightly above normal.     - In stage IIB, cancer is anywhere within the testicle, spermatic cord, or scrotum; and either:                  - has spread to up to 5 lymph nodes in the abdomen; at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 centimeters, but none are larger than 5 centimeters; or       - has spread to more than 5 lymph nodes; the lymph nodes are not larger than 5 centimeters.           All tumor marker levels are normal or slightly above normal.     - In stage IIC, cancer:                  - is anywhere within the testicle, spermatic cord, or scrotum; and       - has spread to a lymph node in the abdomen that is larger than 5 centimeters.           All tumor marker levels are normal or slightly above normal.              Stage III     Stage III is divided into stage IIIA, stage IIIB, and stage IIIC and is determined after an inguinal orchiectomy is done.            - In stage IIIA, cancer:                  - is anywhere within the testicle, spermatic cord, or scrotum; and       - may have spread to one or more lymph nodes in the abdomen; and       - has spread to distant lymph nodes or to the lungs.            Tumor marker levels may range from normal to slightly above normal.     - In stage IIIB, cancer:                  - is anywhere within the testicle, spermatic cord, or scrotum; and       - may have spread to one or more lymph nodes in the abdomen, to distant lymph nodes, or to the lungs.           The level of one or more tumor markers is moderately above normal.     - In stage IIIC, cancer:                  - is anywhere within the testicle, spermatic cord, or scrotum; and       - may have spread to one or more lymph nodes in the abdomen, to distant lymph nodes, or to the lungs.            The level of one or more tumor markers is high. or Cancer:                  - is anywhere within the testicle, spermatic cord, or scrotum; and       - may have spread to one or more lymph nodes in the abdomen; and       - has not spread to distant lymph nodes or the lung but has spread to other parts of the body.           Tumor marker levels may range from normal to high.";"Testicular cancer typically progresses through three main stages:

1. Stage I: The cancer is confined to the testicle and has not spread to other parts of the body.

2. Stage II: The cancer has spread to the lymph nodes in the abdomen or pelvis, but not to distant organs.

3. Stage III: The cancer has spread to distant organs, such as the lungs, liver, or brain.";0.0;1259.0;58.0;0.196;0.06;0.16;0.744;-0.17;-0.398;0.079

Benign prostatic hyperplasia is also called benign prostatic hypertrophy or benign prostatic obstruction.
                
The prostate goes through two main growth periods as a man ages. The first occurs early in puberty, when the prostate doubles in size. The second phase of growth begins around age 25 and continues during most of a mans life. Benign prostatic hyperplasia often occurs with the second growth phase.
                
As the prostate enlarges, the gland presses against and pinches the urethra. The bladder wall becomes thicker. Eventually, the bladder may weaken and lose the ability to empty completely, leaving some urine in the bladder. The narrowing of the urethra and urinary retentionthe inability to empty the bladder completelycause many of the problems associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia.";Prostate Enlargement: Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) is a common condition that occurs in men as they age. It is caused by the enlargement of the prostate gland, which is located below the bladder. The enlarged prostate can press on the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body, making it difficult to urinate. Symptoms of BPH can include difficulty starting or maintaining a urine stream, weak or slow urine flow, increased frequency of urination, and the feeling of not being able to fully empty the bladder. Treatment options for BPH include medications, minimally invasive procedures, and surgery.;0.024;121.0;90.0;0.313;0.05;0.204;0.859;0.074;0.06;0.086

Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal pyramidal signs - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Cerebellar atrophy - Dysarthria - Gait ataxia - Hyperreflexia - Intellectual disability - Limb ataxia - Limb dysmetria - Morphological abnormality of the pyramidal tract - Motor delay - Muscular hypotonia - Nystagmus - Progressive cerebellar ataxia - Slow progression - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.;Spinocerebellar ataxia type 13 (SCA13) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system. Symptoms typically begin in adulthood and may include difficulty with balance and coordination, slurred speech, muscle weakness, tremors, and impaired eye movements.

The cancers most often associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome include breast cancer, a form of bone cancer called osteosarcoma, and cancers of soft tissues (such as muscle) called soft tissue sarcomas. Other cancers commonly seen in this syndrome include brain tumors, cancers of blood-forming tissues (leukemias), and a cancer called adrenocortical carcinoma that affects the outer layer of the adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands on top of each kidney). Several other types of cancer also occur more frequently in people with Li-Fraumeni syndrome.  A very similar condition called Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome shares many of the features of classic Li-Fraumeni syndrome.

Individuals with LFS have a much higher chance of developing cancer, including breast cancer, leukemia, brain tumors, soft tissue sarcomas, and bone cancers like osteosarcoma. This condition is caused by mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene, which normally helps control cell growth and prevent tumors from forming. Due to these mutations, cells can grow unchecked, leading to the development of cancer. Genetic testing is available to determine if an individual carries the LFS gene mutation, and regular medical screening is recommended for early detection and treatment of potential cancers.;0.041;136.0;104.0;0.286;0.08;0.19;0.764;0.087;0.054;0.118

Preventing Secondary Brain Damage Currently, scientists are studying the risk factors for stroke and the process of brain damage that results from stroke. Some brain damage may be secondary, occurring after the initial death of brain cells caused by the lack of blood flow to the brain tissue. This secondary brain damage results from a toxic reaction to the primary damage. Researchers are studying this toxic reaction and ways to prevent secondary injury to the brain. Scientists hope to develop neuroprotective agents, or drugs that protect the brain, to prevent this damage. Animal Studies Scientists are also conducting stroke studies in animals. By studying stroke in animals, researchers hope to get a better picture of what might be happening in human stroke patients. Scientists can also use animal models to test promising therapies for stroke. If a therapy proves helpful for animals, scientists can consider testing the therapy in humans. One promising area of animal research involves hibernation. The dramatic decrease of blood flow to the brain in hibernating animals is so extensive that it would kill a non-hibernating animal. If scientists can discover how animals hibernate without experiencing brain damage, they may discover ways to stop the brain damage associated with decreased blood flow in stroke patients. Another study used a vaccine that interferes with inflammation inside blood vessels to reduce the frequency and severity of strokes in animals with high blood pressure and a genetic predisposition to stroke. Researchers hope that the vaccine will work in humans and could be used to prevent many of the strokes that occur each year in people with high risk factors. Can the Brain Repair Itself? Scientists also are working to develop new and better ways to help the brain repair itself to restore important functions to stroke patients. New advances in imaging and rehabilitation have shown that the brain can compensate for functions lost as a result of stroke. When cells in an area of the brain responsible for a particular function die after a stroke, the patient becomes unable to perform that function. However, the brain's ability to learn and change, called plasticity, and its ability to rewire the connections between its nerve cells means that it can compensate for lost functions. One part of the brain can actually change functions and take up the more important functions of a disabled part. Clinical Trials Clinical trials are scientific studies using volunteers that give researchers a way to test medical advances in humans. Clinical trials test surgical devices and procedures, medications, and rehabilitation therapies. They also test methods to improve lifestyles and mental and social skills. Clinical trials may compare a new medical approach to a standard one that is already available or to a placebo that contains no active ingredients or to no intervention. Some clinical trials compare interventions that are already available to each other. When a new product or approach is being studied, it is not usually known whether it will be helpful, harmful, or no different than available alternatives (including no intervention). The investigators try to determine the safety and usefulness of the intervention by measuring certain outcomes in the participants. Scientists are using clinical trials to - develop new and more effective treatments for stroke  - discover ways to restore blood flow to the brain after stroke  - improve recovery after stroke  - learn more about the risk factors for stroke.  develop new and more effective treatments for stroke discover ways to restore blood flow to the brain after stroke improve recovery after stroke learn more about the risk factors for stroke. Participating in a clinical study contributes to medical knowledge. The results of these studies can make a difference in the care of future patients by providing information about the benefits and risks of therapeutic, preventative, or diagnostic products or interventions.

These include clinical trials investigating the efficacy of new drug therapies, such as neuroprotective agents and clot-busting drugs, to minimize brain damage during a stroke. Additionally, there are ongoing studies examining the potential of stem cell therapy, gene therapy, and rehabilitation interventions to promote brain repair and functional recovery after a stroke. Researchers are also exploring the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance stroke diagnosis, predict outcomes, and personalize treatment strategies. These ongoing research endeavors aim to improve patient outcomes, enhance stroke prevention strategies, and provide comprehensive care for stroke survivors.;0.0;700.0;104.0;0.188;0.039;0.099;0.56;-0.038;-0.176;0.106

148;gemini-pro;causes;What causes Peutz-Jeghers syndrome ?;What causes Peutz-Jeghers syndrome? Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is caused by changes (mutations) in the STK11 gene. STK11 is a tumor suppressor gene which means that it encodes a protein that helps keep cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Mutations in STK11 result in a defective protein that is unable to carry out its normal role. This leads to the development of the polyps and tumors found in PJS. Some people with PJS do not have mutations in the STK11 gene. In these cases, the cause is unknown.;Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the formation of gastrointestinal polyps and distinctive melanin pigmentation on the skin and mucous membranes. It is caused by mutations in the LKB1/STK11 gene, which is involved in cell growth and differentiation. These mutations lead to the formation of polyps, which are growths of tissue that can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract, but are most commonly found in the stomach and small intestine. Additionally, the gene mutation causes an increase in melanin production, resulting in the characteristic pigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes.;0.039;84.0;83.0;0.313;0.104;0.209;0.734;0.12;0.125;0.112
149;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to Czech dysplasia ?;Czech dysplasia is caused by a particular mutation in the COL2A1 gene. The COL2A1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that forms type II collagen. This type of collagen is found mostly in the clear gel that fills the eyeball (the vitreous) and in cartilage. Cartilage is a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone, except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose and external ears. Type II collagen is essential for the normal development of bones and other connective tissues that form the body's supportive framework. Mutations in the COL2A1 gene interfere with the assembly of type II collagen molecules, which prevents bones and other connective tissues from developing properly.;Czech dysplasia, also known as Mabry syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of the skeleton and other organs. It is caused by mutations in the N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 12 (GALNT12) gene, which is responsible for producing an enzyme that is involved in the synthesis of glycosaminoglycans, a type of sugar molecule that is found in the extracellular matrix. Mutations in the GALNT12 gene can lead to a deficiency of this enzyme, which can then disrupt the normal development of various tissues and organs, including the skeleton, eyes, and heart.;0.034;121.0;79.0;0.338;0.112;0.262;0.698;0.069;0.081;0.054

151;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is Chediak-Higashi syndrome inherited ?;This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.;Yes, Chediak-Higashi syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning that both copies of the CHS1 gene (located on chromosome 1) must carry a mutation for the disorder to manifest. This means that affected individuals inherit one copy of the mutated gene from each parent, who are typically unaffected carriers. The inheritance pattern explains why the syndrome typically affects both males and females equally, and why siblings of an affected individual have a 25% chance of inheriting the condition.;0.135;44.0;70.0;0.473;0.18;0.344;0.602;0.29;0.443;0.143
152;gemini-pro;symptoms;What are the symptoms of Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency ?;"What are the signs and symptoms of Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency? Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) deficiency can have a significant effect on fetal development, which may become apparent during late pregnancy with poor fetal weight gain and decreasing levels of estriol in the urine of the mother during pregnancy. Delivery may be complicated, and babies may have low Apgar scores. A low birth weight is common. It has been suggested that there is a characteristic abnormal appearance associated with PDH deficiency, which may include a narrow head, prominent forehead (frontal bossing), wide nasal bridge, long philtrum and flared nostrils; however, these are not seen in all individuals and these features may occur with other disorders as well. Other abnormalities that have been reported include a simian crease, short neck, slight shortening of the limbs, flexion contractures (bent fingers), pes cavus (high arched foot), club foot, ventricular septal defect, and hydronephrosis. Individuals with PDH deficiency typically develop symptoms soon after birth. In general, there are two major types of onset: metabolic and neurological. The metabolic type presents as severe lactic acidosis (too much lactate in the bloodstream). This often does not respond to treatment, thus many of the individuals with this type of onset die during the newborn period (in very few cases, the lactic acidosis has been reported to respond to high doses of thiamine). Some individuals with severe lactic acidosis have also had severe hyperammonemia (high levels of ammonia in the blood). Individuals with the neurological type typically have hypotonia (poor muscle tone), poor feeding, and lethargy, and they later develop seizures. This type typically progresses to severe mental retardation, microcephaly (small head), blindness, and spasticity with secondary contractures (damage to muscles and tendons). However, long term survival is possible and several individuals with this type have reportedly reached their teens. Between these two extremes, there is a continuous range of intermediate forms. When the metabolic abnormalities (lactic acidosis and hyperammonemia) are less severe, the onset may be delayed until later in infancy, and these individuals may have intermittent episodes of lactic acidosis, which often is brought on by an illness and is associated with cerebellar ataxia (abnormal muscle movement). Some of the individuals with primarily neurological symptoms are said to have Leigh's disease. Although PDH deficiency occurs in males and females equally, the presentation of the disease differs between them. The metabolic type, especially the severe neonatal lactic acidosis, is much more common in males; the chronic, neurological form is much more common in females. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.";Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency is a rare inherited disorder that affects the body's ability to convert pyruvate, a product of glucose breakdown, into acetyl-CoA, which is necessary for energy production. This can lead to a buildup of pyruvate and lactate in the blood and a deficiency of acetyl-CoA, which can result in a variety of symptoms, including delayed development, intellectual disability, seizures, muscle weakness, difficulty feeding, poor growth, recurrent infections, and lactic acidosis (a buildup of lactic acid in the blood).;0.0;740.0;71.0;0.137;0.022;0.073;0.644;-0.161;-0.358;0.051
153;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) congenital plasminogen deficiency ?;"Congenital plasminogen deficiency is a disorder that results in inflamed growths on the mucous membranes, which are the moist tissues that line body openings such as the eyelids and the inside of the mouth. Development of the growths are usually triggered by infections or injury, but they may also occur spontaneously in the absence of known triggers. The growths may recur after being removed.  Congenital plasminogen deficiency most often affects the conjunctiva, which are the mucous membranes that protect the white part of the eye (the sclera) and line the eyelids. A characteristic feature of this disorder is ligneous conjunctivitis, in which a buildup of a protein called fibrin causes inflammation of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis) and leads to thick, woody (ligneous), inflamed growths that are yellow, white, or red. Ligneous conjunctivitis most often occurs on the inside of the eyelids. However, in about one-third of cases, ligneous conjunctivitis over the sclera grows onto the cornea, which is the clear covering that protects the colored part of the eye (the iris) and pupil. Such growths can tear the cornea or cause scarring. These corneal problems as well as obstruction by growths inside the eyelid can lead to vision loss.  People with congenital plasminogen deficiency may also develop ligneous growths on other mucous membranes, including the inside of the mouth and the gums; the lining of the nasal cavity; and in females, the vagina. Growths on the mucous membranes that line the gastrointestinal tract may result in ulcers. The growths may also develop in the windpipe, which can cause life-threatening airway obstruction, especially in children. In a small number of cases, affected individuals are born with impaired drainage of the fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord (the cerebrospinal fluid or CSF), resulting in a buildup of this fluid in the skull (occlusive hydrocephalus). It is unclear how this feature is related to the other signs and symptoms of congenital plasminogen deficiency.";Congenital plasminogen deficiency is a rare bleeding disorder characterized by a deficiency of plasminogen, a protein necessary for the breakdown of blood clots. This deficiency can lead to an increased risk of bleeding, bruising, and difficulty forming clots. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, and may include excessive bleeding from cuts or injuries, prolonged bleeding after surgery or childbirth, and easy bruising. Diagnosis is made through blood tests that measure plasminogen levels and activity. Treatment typically involves replacement therapy with plasminogen concentrate, which can help to reduce the risk of bleeding and improve overall health.;0.007;277.0;90.0;0.192;0.036;0.144;0.541;-0.126;-0.274;0.029
154;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is Muir-Torre syndrome inherited ?;How is Muir-Torre syndrome inherited? Muir-Torre-syndrome (MTS) is a variant of Lynch syndrome and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having only one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough for a person to develop the condition. When a person with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the mutated copy of the responsible gene. It is important to note that people who inherit a mutated gene that causes MTS inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit a mutation in an associated gene will develop cancer. This phenomenon is called reduced penetrance. The majority of people diagnosed with a form of Lynch syndrome have inherited the mutated gene from a parent. However, because not all people with a mutation develop cancer, and the variable age at which cancer may develop, not all people with a mutation have a parent who had cancer. Thus, the family history may appear negative. A positive family history of MTS is identified in roughly 50% of affected people. The percentage of people with Lynch syndrome who have a new mutation in the gene that occurred for the first time (and was not inherited from a parent) is unknown but is estimated to be extremely low.;Yes, Muir-Torre syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that only one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. It is associated with mutations in mismatch repair genes, primarily MLH1 and MSH2, which play a crucial role in maintaining the stability of the genome. These mutations are inherited from a parent who carries the altered gene, and each offspring of an affected individual has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation and developing the syndrome.;0.03;197.0;72.0;0.387;0.142;0.335;0.769;0.161;0.045;0.28

                    - After penile cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the penis or to other parts of the body.    - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.    - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.    - The following stages are used for penile cancer:          - Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)     - Stage I     - Stage II     - Stage III     - Stage IV
                
                
                    After penile cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the penis or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the penis or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.    The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:         -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram.    -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The tissue sample is removed during one of the following procedures:                -  Sentinel lymph node biopsy : The removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor. A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor. The substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes. The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes.      -  Lymph node dissection : A procedure to remove one or more lymph nodes during surgery. A sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called a lymphadenectomy.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if penile cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually penile cancer cells. The disease is metastatic penile cancer, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for penile cancer:
                    Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)    In stage 0, abnormal cells or growths that look like warts are found on the surface of the skin of the penis. These abnormal cells or growths may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.       Stage I    In stage I, cancer has formed and spread to connective tissue just under the skin of the penis. Cancer has not spread to lymph vessels or blood vessels. The tumor cells look a lot like normal cells under a microscope.       Stage II    In stage II, cancer has spread:            - to connective tissue just under the skin of the penis. Also, cancer has spread to lymph vessels or blood vessels or the tumor cells may look very different from normal cells under a microscope; or     - through connective tissue to erectile tissue (spongy tissue that fills with blood to make an erection); or     - beyond erectile tissue to the urethra.              Stage III     Stage III is divided into stage IIIa and stage IIIb.     In stage IIIa, cancer has spread to one lymph node in the groin. Cancer has also spread:            - to connective tissue just under the skin of the penis. Also, cancer may have spread to lymph vessels or blood vessels or the tumor cells may look very different from normal cells under a microscope; or     - through connective tissue to erectile tissue (spongy tissue that fills with blood to make an erection); or     - beyond erectile tissue to the urethra.           In stage IIIb, cancer has spread to more than one lymph node on one side of the groin or to lymph nodes on both sides of the groin. Cancer has also spread:            - to connective tissue just under the skin of the penis. Also, cancer may have spread to lymph vessels or blood vessels or the tumor cells may look very different from normal cells under a microscope; or      - through connective tissue to erectile tissue (spongy tissue that fills with blood to make an erection); or     - beyond erectile tissue to the urethra.              Stage IV    In stage IV, cancer has spread:            - to tissues near the penis such as the prostate, and may have spread to lymph nodes in the groin or pelvis; or      - to one or more lymph nodes in the pelvis, or cancer has spread from the lymph nodes to the tissues around the lymph nodes; or     - to distant parts of the body.";"Penile cancer, a rare form of cancer that begins in the skin of the penis, typically progresses through four stages:

1. **Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ):** Abnormal cells are confined to the top layer of the skin on the penis.
2. **Stage I:** The cancer has invaded deeper into the skin but has not spread to nearby lymph nodes or other organs.
3. **Stage II:** The cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes but is still confined to the pelvis.
4. **Stage III:** The cancer has spread to lymph nodes beyond the pelvis or to other organs, such as the bladder, rectum, or distant lymph nodes.";0.0;1017.0;93.0;0.259;0.086;0.197;0.688;-0.176;-0.347;0.003

Difficulty with reading and spelling (dyslexia) has been reported in some girls with periventricular heterotopia. Less commonly, individuals with periventricular heterotopia may have more severe brain malformations, small head size (microcephaly), developmental delays, recurrent infections, blood vessel abnormalities, or other problems. In the X-linked form of periventricular nodular heterotopia, affected patients are mostly females because in males the symptoms are too serious and they die before birth. The following clinical features have been reported: seizure disorder, mental problems, heart anomalies, stomach immobility, strabismus, short fingers and dyslexia. Periventricular heterotopia may also occur in association with other conditions such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (Ehlers-Danlos with periventricular heterotopia) which results in extremely flexible joints, skin that stretches easily, and fragile blood vessels. In the autosomal recessive form of periventricular heterotopia the disorder is severe and may include microcephaly, severe developmental delay, and seizures beginning in infancy. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but do not show any signs or symptoms of this condition.;Periventricular heterotopia is a rare brain malformation that occurs when neurons fail to migrate properly during fetal development, resulting in abnormal positioning of gray matter within the brain. Symptoms of periventricular heterotopia can vary depending on the severity of the condition and the specific brain regions affected, but may include seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disability, difficulty with coordination and balance, speech problems, and behavioral issues. Additionally, periventricular heterotopia can sometimes lead to hydrocephalus, a condition characterized by an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid within the brain's ventricles, which can further contribute to symptoms and complications.;0.018;211.0;87.0;0.251;0.058;0.135;0.72;0.053;-0.057;0.164

More than 100 types of peripheral neuropathy have been identified, each with its own characteristic set of symptoms, pattern of development, and prognosis. Impaired function and symptoms depend on the type of nerves -- motor, sensory, or autonomic -- that are damaged. Some people may experience temporary numbness, tingling, and pricking sensations, sensitivity to touch, or muscle weakness. Others may suffer more extreme symptoms, including burning pain (especially at night), muscle wasting, paralysis, or organ or gland dysfunction. Peripheral neuropathy may be either inherited or acquired. Causes of acquired peripheral neuropathy include physical injury (trauma) to a nerve, tumors, toxins, autoimmune responses, nutritional deficiencies, alcoholism, medical procedures, and vascular and metabolic disorders.

164;gemini-pro;information;Do you have information about Breastfeeding;Summary : Breastfeeding offers many benefits to your baby. Breast milk contains the right balance of nutrients to help your infant grow into a strong and healthy toddler. Some of the nutrients in breast milk also help protect your infant against some common childhood illnesses and infections. It may also help your health. Certain types of cancer may occur less often in mothers who have breastfed their babies.    Women who don't have health problems should try to give their babies breast milk for at least the first six months of life. Most women with health problems can breastfeed. There are rare exceptions when women are advised not to breastfeed because they have certain illnesses. Some medicines, illegal drugs, and alcohol can also pass through the breast milk and cause harm to your baby. Check with your health care provider if you have concerns about whether you should breastfeed.    If you are having problems with breastfeeding, contact a lactation consultant.    NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development;Breastfeeding, the natural way of feeding infants, offers numerous benefits for both mothers and babies. It provides complete nutrition, including essential vitamins, minerals, and antibodies, supporting optimal growth and development. Breastfeeding reduces the risk of allergies, respiratory infections, and diarrheal diseases in infants, promoting long-term health. It also strengthens the emotional bond between mother and child and may provide health advantages for mothers, such as a lower risk of breast and ovarian cancers. Exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months is recommended by health organizations, followed by continued breastfeeding with appropriate complementary foods until two years of age or beyond.;0.013;161.0;95.0;0.243;0.017;0.173;0.745;0.1;0.039;0.159

                    - Parathyroid cancer is a rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of a parathyroid gland.    - Having certain inherited disorders can increase the risk of developing parathyroid cancer.     - Signs and symptoms of parathyroid cancer include weakness, feeling tired, and a lump in the neck.    - Tests that examine the neck and blood are used to detect (find) and diagnose parathyroid cancer.    - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    Parathyroid cancer is a rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of a parathyroid gland.
                    The parathyroid glands are four pea-sized organs found in the neck near the thyroid gland. The parathyroid glands make parathyroid hormone (PTH or parathormone). PTH helps the body use and store calcium to keep the calcium in the blood at normal levels.     A parathyroid gland may become overactive and make too much PTH, a condition called hyperparathyroidism. Hyperparathyroidism can occur when a benign tumor (noncancer), called an adenoma, forms on one of the parathyroid glands, and causes it to grow and become overactive. Sometimes hyperparathyroidism can be caused by parathyroid cancer, but this is very rare.   The extra PTH causes:          - The calcium stored in the bones to move into the blood.    - The intestines to absorb more calcium from the food we eat.        This condition is called hypercalcemia (too much calcium in the blood).   The hypercalcemia caused by hyperparathyroidism is more serious and life-threatening than parathyroid cancer itself and treating hypercalcemia is as important as treating the cancer.";Parathyroid cancer, also known as parathyroid carcinoma, is a rare endocrine malignancy that arises from the parathyroid glands, responsible for regulating calcium and phosphate levels in the body. It is characterized by the uncontrolled growth and proliferation of parathyroid cells, often leading to an overproduction of parathyroid hormone (PTH). The excessive PTH levels can cause hyperparathyroidism, a condition marked by abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood, leading to various complications affecting bones, kidneys, and other organs. Parathyroid cancer is typically slow-growing and may remain asymptomatic in its early stages, making diagnosis challenging. Treatment options depend on the extent and severity of the cancer but may involve surgical removal of the affected gland(s), radiation therapy, and targeted therapies to manage PTH levels and prevent complications.;0.021;220.0;115.0;0.313;0.074;0.172;0.802;0.06;0.042;0.074
166;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease ?;Biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease is a disorder that affects the nervous system, including a group of structures in the brain called the basal ganglia, which help control movement. As its name suggests, the condition may improve if the vitamins biotin and thiamine are given as treatment. Without early and lifelong vitamin treatment, people with biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease experience a variety of neurological problems that gradually get worse. The occurrence of specific neurological problems and their severity vary even among affected individuals within the same family.  The signs and symptoms of biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease usually begin between the ages of 3 and 10, but the disorder can appear at any age. Many of the neurological problems that can occur in biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease affect movement, and can include involuntary tensing of various muscles (dystonia), muscle rigidity, muscle weakness on one or both sides of the body (hemiparesis or quadriparesis), problems coordinating movements (ataxia), and exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia). Movement problems can also affect the face, and may include the inability to move facial muscles due to facial nerve paralysis (supranuclear facial palsy), paralysis of the eye muscles (external ophthalmoplegia), difficulty chewing or swallowing (dysphagia), and slurred speech. Affected individuals may also experience confusion, loss of previously learned skills, intellectual disability, and seizures. Severe cases may result in coma and become life-threatening.  Typically, the neurological symptoms occur as increasingly severe episodes, which may be triggered by fever, injury, or other stresses on the body. Less commonly, the signs and symptoms persist at the same level or slowly increase in severity over time rather than occurring as episodes that come and go. In these individuals, the neurological problems are usually limited to dystonia, seizure disorders, and delay in the development of mental and motor skills (psychomotor delay).;Biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease (BTBGD) is a rare, inherited neurological disorder caused by a defect in the transport of biotin and thiamine into the cells. This leads to a deficiency of biotin and thiamine in the brain and spinal cord, which can cause a variety of neurological symptoms, including seizures, movement disorders, and intellectual disability. BTBGD is typically diagnosed in infancy or early childhood, and treatment involves taking high doses of biotin and thiamine. Early diagnosis and treatment can help to prevent or minimize the symptoms of BTBGD.;0.008;272.0;80.0;0.271;0.074;0.154;0.764;-0.061;-0.232;0.119

Before birth, these disorders result in the abnormal development of structures including the skin, hair, nails, teeth, and sweat glands.  Most people with hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia have a reduced ability to sweat (hypohidrosis) because they have fewer sweat glands than normal or their sweat glands do not function properly. Sweating is a major way that the body controls its temperature; as sweat evaporates from the skin, it cools the body. An inability to sweat can lead to a dangerously high body temperature (hyperthermia), particularly in hot weather. In some cases, hyperthermia can cause life-threatening medical problems.  Affected individuals tend to have sparse scalp and body hair (hypotrichosis). The hair is often light-colored, brittle, and slow-growing. This condition is also characterized by absent teeth (hypodontia) or teeth that are malformed. The teeth that are present are frequently small and pointed.  Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia is associated with distinctive facial features including a prominent forehead, thick lips, and a flattened bridge of the nose.

Hereditary sensory neuropathy type IE (HSNIE) is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having only one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of the condition. When a person with a mutation that causes HSNIE has children, each child has a 50% (1/2) chance to inherit the mutated gene. A person who does not inherit the mutation from an affected parent is not at risk to pass the condition on to his/her children.;Yes, Hereditary sensory neuropathy type IE (HSN1E) is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning both copies of the gene responsible for the condition must be mutated in order for a person to develop the disorder. In other words, if an individual inherits one normal copy and one mutated copy of the gene, they will be a carrier of the condition, but they will not display any symptoms. Both parents of an affected individual must carry a mutated copy of the gene in order for their child to inherit the condition.;0.111;81.0;78.0;0.411;0.164;0.318;0.845;0.259;0.235;0.281

                    - After laryngeal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the larynx or to other parts of the body.     - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.    - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.    - The following stages are used for laryngeal cancer:         - Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)     - Stage I     - Stage II     - Stage III     - Stage IV
                
                
                    After laryngeal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the larynx or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the larynx or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage of the disease in order to plan treatment. The results of some of the tests used to diagnose laryngeal cancer are often also used to stage the disease.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if laryngeal cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually laryngeal cancer cells. The disease is metastatic laryngeal cancer, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for laryngeal cancer:
                    Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)    In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the lining of the larynx. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.       Stage I    In stage I, cancer has formed. Stage I laryngeal cancer depends on where cancer began in the larynx:            -  Supraglottis: Cancer is in one area of the supraglottis only and the vocal cords can move normally.     -  Glottis: Cancer is in one or both vocal cords and the vocal cords can move normally.     -  Subglottis: Cancer is in the subglottis only.              Stage II    In stage II, cancer is in the larynx only. Stage II laryngeal cancer depends on where cancer began in the larynx:            -  Supraglottis: Cancer is in more than one area of the supraglottis or surrounding tissues.     -  Glottis: Cancer has spread to the supraglottis and/or the subglottis and/or the vocal cords cannot move normally.     - Subglottis: Cancer has spread to one or both vocal cords, which may not move normally.               Stage III     Stage III laryngeal cancer depends on whether cancer has spread from the supraglottis, glottis, or subglottis.    In stage III cancer of the supraglottis:            -  cancer is in the larynx only and the vocal cords cannot move, and/or cancer is in tissues next to the larynx. Cancer may have spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller; or     - cancer is in one area of the supraglottis and in one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor; the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller and the vocal cords can move normally; or     - cancer is in more than one area of the supraglottis or surrounding tissues and in one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor; the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller.           In stage III cancer of the glottis:            - cancer is in the larynx only and the vocal cords cannot move, and/or cancer is in tissues next to the larynx; cancer may have spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller; or     - cancer is in one or both vocal cords and in one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor; the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller and the vocal cords can move normally; or     - cancer has spread to the supraglottis and/or the subglottis and/or the vocal cords cannot move normally. Cancer has also spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller.           In stage III cancer of the subglottis:            - cancer is in the larynx and the vocal cords cannot move; cancer may have spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller; or     - cancer is in the subglottis and in one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor; the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller; or     - cancer has spread to one or both vocal cords, which may not move normally. Cancer has also spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller.              Stage IV     Stage IV is divided into stage IVA, stage IVB, and stage IVC. Each substage is the same for cancer in the supraglottis, glottis, or subglottis.            - In stage IVA:                   - cancer has spread through the thyroid cartilage and/or has spread to tissues beyond the larynx such as the neck, trachea, thyroid, or esophagus. Cancer may have spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller; or       - cancer has spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor and the lymph node is larger than 3 centimeters but not larger than 6 centimeters, or has spread to more than one lymph node anywhere in the neck with none larger than 6 centimeters. Cancer may have spread to tissues beyond the larynx, such as the neck, trachea, thyroid, or esophagus. The vocal cords may not move normally.                 - In stage IVB:                   -  cancer has spread to the space in front of the spinal column, surrounds the carotid artery, or has spread to parts of the chest. Cancer may have spread to one or more lymph nodes anywhere in the neck and the lymph nodes may be any size; or       -  cancer has spread to a lymph node that is larger than 6 centimeters and may have spread as far as the space in front of the spinal column, around the carotid artery, or to parts of the chest. The vocal cords may not move normally.                - In stage IVC, cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs, liver, or bone.";"Laryngeal cancer, commonly known as cancer of the voice box, progresses through four distinct stages, each characterized by the extent and severity of the tumor's growth:

Stage I: The cancer is confined to one area of the larynx, typically the vocal cords, and is limited to the superficial layers of tissue.

Stage II: The cancer has grown deeper into the larynx, affecting multiple areas or extending to adjacent structures like the epiglottis or arytenoids. However, it remains localized within the larynx.

Stage III: The cancer has spread beyond the larynx, involving nearby lymph nodes in the neck, and may have invaded surrounding tissues, causing difficulty swallowing, breathing, or speaking.

Stage IV: The cancer has metastasized to distant sites in the body, such as the lungs, liver, or bones, indicating advanced and widespread disease.";0.0;1100.0;116.0;0.338;0.121;0.231;0.695;-0.122;-0.218;-0.027
177;gemini-pro;exams and tests;How to diagnose Childhood Vascular Tumors ?;Tests are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood vascular tumors. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps, lesions, or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.     -   Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).     -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. A biopsy is not always needed to diagnose a vascular tumor.;Diagnosis of childhood vascular tumors involves a combination of clinical evaluation, imaging studies, and sometimes biopsy. A detailed medical history and physical examination are performed to assess the location, size, and characteristics of the tumor. Imaging studies such as ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed tomography (CT) scans are used to further evaluate the tumor's extent and involvement of surrounding structures. In some cases, a biopsy may be recommended to obtain a tissue sample for pathological examination, which can help confirm the diagnosis and determine the specific type of vascular tumor. Multidisciplinary consultation involving specialists such as pediatric oncologists, surgeons, and radiologists may be necessary to determine the most appropriate diagnostic and treatment approach.;0.018;217.0;105.0;0.305;0.068;0.167;0.658;-0.055;-0.146;0.036
178;gemini-pro;causes;What causes Joubert syndrome ?;What causes Joubert syndrome? Joubert syndrome and related disorders may be caused by changes (mutations) in any of many genes (some of which are unknown). The proteins made from these genes are either known, or thought, to affect cell structures called cilia. Cilia are projections on the cell surface that play a role in signaling. They are important for many cell types, including neurons, liver cells and kidney cells. Cilia also play a role in the senses such as sight, hearing, and smell. Mutations in the genes responsible for Joubert syndrome and related disorders cause problems with the structure and function of cilia, likely disrupting important signaling pathways during development. However, it is still unclear how specific developmental abnormalities result from these problems.;Joubert syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by hypotonia (low muscle tone), ataxia (difficulty with balance and coordination), and developmental delay. It is caused by mutations in several genes that encode proteins necessary for proper brain development, particularly those involved in the formation of the brainstem and cerebellum. These mutations can be inherited from either parent or can occur spontaneously. Joubert syndrome is a heterogeneous disorder, meaning that it can have a variety of genetic causes and clinical presentations.;0.017;116.0;75.0;0.333;0.045;0.159;0.703;0.061;0.037;0.083

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.;Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter (LVWM) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of white matter in the brain. Symptoms of LVWM typically appear in childhood or early adulthood and may include difficulty with coordination and balance, muscle weakness, involuntary muscle movements, seizures, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. As the disease progresses, individuals may experience difficulty swallowing, speaking, and breathing. LVWM is a fatal disorder, and there is currently no cure or effective treatment.;0.007;250.0;72.0;0.175;0.034;0.136;0.59;-0.235;-0.376;-0.089

Subtypes of Waardenburg syndrome type 2 are determined by the suspected genetic cause of the condition in a family.  In some subtypes, the genetic cause is a known gene.  In other subtypes, the general location (locus) of the genetic cause has been identified, but the specific gene is not yet known.  There are five different subtypes:  Type 2A is caused by a change (mutation) in the MITF gene on chromosome 3 Type 2B is associated with a locus on chromosome 1 Type 2C is associated with a locus on chromosome 8 Type 2D is caused by mutations is the SNAI2 gene on chromosome 8 Type 2E is caused by mutations in the SOX10 gene on chromosome 22 Because subtypes are defined by the underlying genetic cause, they are not diagnosed by physical features identified during a physical exam.  Physical features may be used to distinguish between types of Waardenburg syndrome, such as Type 1 or Type 2, but do not help identify a specific subtype.;;0.0;157.0;1.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;-0.054;-0.361;-0.596;-0.104
181;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to familial dysautonomia ?;Mutations in the IKBKAP gene cause familial dysautonomia.  The IKBKAP gene provides instructions for making a protein called IKK complex-associated protein (IKAP). This protein is found in a variety of cells throughout the body, including brain cells.  Nearly all individuals with familial dysautonomia have two copies of the same IKBKAP gene mutation in each cell. This mutation can disrupt how information in the IKBKAP gene is pieced together to make a blueprint for the production of IKAP protein. As a result of this error, a reduced amount of normal IKAP protein is produced. This mutation behaves inconsistently, however. Some cells produce near normal amounts of the protein, and other cellsparticularly brain cellshave very little of the protein. Critical activities in brain cells are probably disrupted by reduced amounts or the absence of IKAP protein, leading to the signs and symptoms of familial dysautonomia.;Familial dysautonomia, also known as Riley-Day syndrome, is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in the ELP1 gene, located on chromosome 9. These mutations lead to the production of a non-functional ELP1 protein, which is involved in the regulation of gene expression, cell signaling, and cell adhesion. The genetic changes related to familial dysautonomia result in abnormal development and function of the autonomic nervous system, leading to a range of symptoms including difficulty with motor coordination, impaired temperature regulation, abnormal heart rate and blood pressure, and problems with digestion and elimination.;0.015;128.0;83.0;0.271;0.041;0.157;0.55;-0.027;-0.062;0.005

184;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) myotonic dystrophy ?;Myotonic dystrophy is part of a group of inherited disorders called muscular dystrophies. It is the most common form of muscular dystrophy that begins in adulthood.  Myotonic dystrophy is characterized by progressive muscle wasting and weakness. People with this disorder often have prolonged muscle contractions (myotonia) and are not able to relax certain muscles after use. For example, a person may have difficulty releasing their grip on a doorknob or handle. Also, affected people may have slurred speech or temporary locking of their jaw.  Other signs and symptoms of myotonic dystrophy include clouding of the lens of the eye (cataracts) and abnormalities of the electrical signals that control the heartbeat (cardiac conduction defects). In affected men, hormonal changes may lead to early balding and an inability to father a child (infertility). The features of this disorder often develop during a person's twenties or thirties, although they can occur at any age. The severity of the condition varies widely among affected people, even among members of the same family.  There are two major types of myotonic dystrophy: type 1 and type 2. Their signs and symptoms overlap, although type 2 tends to be milder than type 1. The muscle weakness associated with type 1 particularly affects the lower legs, hands, neck, and face. Muscle weakness in type 2 primarily involves the muscles of the neck, shoulders, elbows, and hips. The two types of myotonic dystrophy are caused by mutations in different genes.  A variation of type 1 myotonic dystrophy, called congenital myotonic dystrophy, is apparent at birth. Characteristic features include weak muscle tone (hypotonia), an inward- and upward-turning foot (clubfoot), breathing problems, delayed development, and intellectual disability. Some of these health problems can be life-threatening.;Myotonic dystrophy is a group of hereditary neuromuscular disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness, stiffness, and myotonia, which is a difficulty in relaxing muscles after voluntary contraction. It is caused by a defect in the DMPK gene, which leads to the production of abnormal RNA that interferes with muscle function. Myotonic dystrophy can affect multiple organ systems, including the heart, lungs, eyes, and gastrointestinal tract. There are two main types of myotonic dystrophy: type 1 (DM1) and type 2 (DM2). DM1 is the most common form and typically begins in adulthood, with symptoms including muscle weakness, cataracts, and heart problems. DM2 is less common and usually starts in childhood, with symptoms including muscle weakness, intellectual disability, and respiratory problems.;0.044;262.0;112.0;0.338;0.146;0.236;0.882;0.156;0.072;0.241
185;gemini-pro;exams and tests;How to diagnose Ulcerative Colitis ?;"A health care provider diagnoses ulcerative colitis with the following:
                
- medical and family history  - physical exam  - lab tests  - endoscopies of the large intestine
                
The health care provider may perform a series of medical tests to rule out other bowel disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, or celiac disease, that may cause symptoms similar to those of ulcerative colitis. Read more about these conditions on the Digestive Disease A-Z list.
                
Medical and Family History
                
Taking a medical and family history can help the health care provider diagnose ulcerative colitis and understand a patient's symptoms. The health care provider will also ask the patient about current and past medical conditions and medications.
                
Physical Exam
                
A physical exam may help diagnose ulcerative colitis. During a physical exam, the health care provider most often
                
- checks for abdominal distension, or swelling  - listens to sounds within the abdomen using a stethoscope  - taps on the abdomen to check for tenderness and pain
                
Lab Tests
                
A health care provider may order lab tests to help diagnose ulcerative colitis, including blood and stool tests.
                
Blood tests. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care provider's office or a lab. A lab technologist will analyze the blood sample. A health care provider may use blood tests to look for
                
- anemia  - inflammation or infection somewhere in the body  - markers that show ongoing inflammation  - low albumin, or proteincommon in patients with severe ulcerative colitis
                
Stool tests. A stool test is the analysis of a sample of stool. A health care provider will give the patient a container for catching and storing the stool at home. The patient returns the sample to the health care provider or to a lab. A lab technologist will analyze the stool sample. Health care providers commonly order stool tests to rule out other causes of GI diseases, such as infection.
                
Endoscopies of the Large Intestine
                
Endoscopies of the large intestine are the most accurate methods for diagnosing ulcerative colitis and ruling out other possible conditions, such as Crohn's disease, diverticular disease, or cancer. Endoscopies of the large intestine include
                
- colonoscopy  - flexible sigmoidoscopy
                
Colonoscopy. Colonoscopy is a test that uses a long, flexible, narrow tube with a light and tiny camera on one end, called a colonoscope or scope, to look inside the rectum and entire colon. In most cases, light anesthesia and pain medication help patients relax for the test. The medical staff will monitor a patient's vital signs and try to make him or her as comfortable as possible. A nurse or technician places an intravenous (IV) needle in a vein in the patient's arm or hand to give anesthesia.
                
For the test, the patient will lie on a table or stretcher while the gastroenterologist inserts a colonoscope into the patient's anus and slowly guides it through the rectum and into the colon. The scope inflates the large intestine with air to give the gastroenterologist a better view. The camera sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a monitor, allowing the gastroenterologist to carefully examine the tissues lining the colon and rectum. The gastroenterologist may move the patient several times and adjust the scope for better viewing. Once the scope has reached the opening to the small intestine, the gastroenterologist slowly withdraws it and examines the lining of the colon and rectum again.
                
A colonoscopy can show irritated and swollen tissue, ulcers, and abnormal growths such as polypsextra pieces of tissue that grow on the inner lining of the intestine. If the gastroenterologist suspects ulcerative colitis, he or she will biopsy the patient's colon and rectum. A biopsy is a procedure that involves taking small pieces of tissue for examination with a microscope.
                
A health care provider will give patients written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test. The health care provider will also give patients information about how to care for themselves following the procedure.
                
Flexible sigmoidoscopy. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is a test that uses a flexible, narrow tube with a light and tiny camera on one end, called a sigmoidoscope or scope, to look inside the rectum, the sigmoid colon, and sometimes the descending colon. In most cases, a patient does not need anesthesia.
                
For the test, the patient will lie on a table or stretcher while the health care provider inserts the sigmoidoscope into the patient's anus and slowly guides it through the rectum, the sigmoid colon, and sometimes the descending colon. The scope inflates the large intestine with air to give the health care provider a better view. The camera sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a monitor, allowing the health care provider to examine the tissues lining the sigmoid colon and rectum. The health care provider may ask the patient to move several times and adjust the scope for better viewing. Once the scope reaches the end of the sigmoid colon, the health care provider slowly withdraws it while examining the lining of the colon and rectum again.
                
The health care provider will look for signs of bowel diseases and conditions such as irritated and swollen tissue, ulcers, and polyps.
                
If the health care provider suspects ulcerative colitis, he or she will biopsy the patient's colon and rectum.
                
A health care provider will give patients written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test. The health care provider will also give patients information about how to care for themselves following the procedure.";Ulcerative colitis is typically diagnosed based on a combination of factors, including a detailed medical history, physical examination, stool analysis, blood tests, imaging studies, and endoscopic procedures. The history focuses on symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and blood in the stool. Physical examination may reveal abdominal tenderness or signs of inflammation. Stool analysis can detect the presence of blood, white blood cells, or parasites. Blood tests can assess for anemia, inflammation, and electrolyte imbalances. Imaging studies like X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs may be used to evaluate the extent of inflammation and rule out other conditions. Endoscopic procedures, such as colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, allow direct visualization of the colon and rectum to identify ulcers, inflammation, and biopsies can be taken for further analysis.;0.0;766.0;119.0;0.241;0.039;0.179;0.728;-0.039;-0.149;0.072
186;gemini-pro;exams and tests;How to diagnose Down syndrome ?;How is Down syndrome diagnosed? Down syndrome may be suspected and/or diagnosed during pregnancy, or after a child is born. During pregnancy, a woman can opt to have specific tests that may either screen for, or diagnosis, Down syndrome in a fetus. A screening test poses no risks to the fetus and can determine the likelihood that a fetus has Down syndrome. It may show that a fetus is at an increased risk to be affected, but cannot determine whether it is definitely affected. Screening tests for Down syndrome may involve different types of blood tests for the mother and/or specific types of ultrasounds that can detect features more common in fetuses with Down syndrome (called markers). Depending on the type of screening tests a woman has, they may be done during the 1st trimester, the 2nd trimester, or both. If a screening test shows an increased risk for Down syndrome, a woman may then choose to have a diagnostic test. Diagnostic tests during pregnancy can determine with certainty whether a fetus has Down syndrome, but they are invasive and carry a slight risk of miscarriage. Examples of diagnostic tests include chorionic villus sampling in the 1st trimester and amniocentesis in the 2nd trimester. During these tests, a small sample of genetic material is obtained from the amniotic fluid or placenta, and the fetus' chromosomes are then analyzed in a laboratory. In recent years, non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has become available to women who are at increased risk to have a baby with Down syndrome. NIPT is a blood test that examines DNA from the fetus in the mother's bloodstream. However, women who have a positive NIPT result should then have invasive diagnostic testing to confirm the result. People with questions about the different options for prenatal screening or diagnostic testing should speak with a genetic counselor. A genetic counselor can discuss the benefits, limitations and risks of each test, and help each person decide which test (if any) is best for them. If a diagnosis of Down syndrome is not made prenatally, the diagnosis can be made in the newborn. Down syndrome may be suspected if a newborn has characteristic physical features of the condition. The diagnosis can then be confirmed by obtaining a karyotype (a blood test to look at a picture of the newborn's chromosomes).;Diagnosing Down syndrome typically involves a combination of prenatal screening tests, physical examination, and genetic testing. During pregnancy, specific prenatal screening tests, such as blood tests and ultrasound, can assess the risk of having a baby with Down syndrome. If the screening results indicate a higher risk, further diagnostic tests like amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling are recommended to confirm the diagnosis. After birth, physical examination of the baby's physical characteristics, such as facial features, skin tone, and muscle tone, can provide clues suggestive of Down syndrome. Genetic testing, specifically karyotyping or chromosomal microarray analysis, is performed to analyze the baby's chromosomes and confirm the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21, which is the genetic basis of Down syndrome.;0.009;342.0;110.0;0.301;0.07;0.212;0.854;0.067;-0.05;0.186
187;gemini-pro;information;Do you have information about Blood Count Tests;Summary : Your blood contains red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), and platelets. Blood count tests measure the number and types of cells in your blood. This helps doctors check on your overall health. The tests can also help to diagnose diseases and conditions such as anemia, infections, clotting problems, blood cancers, and immune system disorders.    Specific types include tests for       - RBC - the numbers, size, and types of RBC in the blood    - WBC - the numbers and types of WBC in the blood    - Platelets - the numbers and size of the platelets    - Hemoglobin - an iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen    - Hematocrit - how much space red blood cells take up in your blood    - Reticulocyte count - how many young red blood cells are in your blood    - Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) - the average size of your red blood cells       The complete blood count (CBC) includes most or all of these. The CBC is one of the most common blood tests.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute;A blood count test, also known as a complete blood count (CBC), is a common blood test that evaluates the cells in your blood. It measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, as well as hemoglobin levels and hematocrit.  This information can help your doctor assess your overall health and diagnose or monitor a variety of conditions, including anemia, infection, inflammation, and leukemia. A CBC may also be used to monitor your response to treatment or to check for side effects of certain medications.;0.053;153.0;82.0;0.457;0.134;0.214;0.673;0.196;0.101;0.293
188;gemini-pro;causes;What causes Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency ?;What causes isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (IBD deficiency)? IBD deficiency is caused by mutations in the ACAD8 gene. The ACAD8 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that plays an essential role in breaking down proteins from the diet. Specifically, the enzyme is responsible for processing valine, an amino acid that is part of many proteins. If a mutation in the ACAD8 gene reduces or eliminates the activity of this enzyme, the body is unable to break down valine properly. As a result, poor growth and reduced energy production may occur.;Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is an inherited metabolic disorder caused by a mutation in the gene encoding the enzyme isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IBD). This enzyme is responsible for converting isobutyryl-CoA to crotonyl-CoA in the catabolic pathway of the amino acid valine. The mutation in the IBD gene leads to a deficiency or complete absence of the enzyme, resulting in an accumulation of isobutyryl-CoA and its metabolites in the body. This accumulation can lead to a variety of clinical manifestations, including metabolic acidosis, developmental delay, intellectual disability, seizures, and movement disorders.;0.072;78.0;75.0;0.404;0.139;0.349;0.787;0.17;0.175;0.162

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with colon cancer.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with colon cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Six types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery     Surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is the most common treatment for all stages of colon cancer. A doctor may remove the cancer using one of the following types of surgery:            -  Local excision: If the cancer is found at a very early stage, the doctor may remove it without cutting through the abdominal wall. Instead, the doctor may put a tube with a cutting tool through the rectum into the colon and cut the cancer out. This is called a local excision. If the cancer is found in a polyp (a small bulging area of tissue), the operation is called a polypectomy.     -  Resection of the colon with anastomosis: If the cancer is larger, the doctor will perform a partial colectomy (removing the cancer and a small amount of healthy tissue around it). The doctor may then perform an anastomosis (sewing the healthy parts of the colon together). The doctor will also usually remove lymph nodes near the colon and examine them under a microscope to see whether they contain cancer.     - Resection of the colon with colostomy: If the doctor is not able to sew the 2 ends of the colon back together, a stoma (an opening) is made on the outside of the body for waste to pass through. This procedure is called a colostomy. A bag is placed around the stoma to collect the waste. Sometimes the colostomy is needed only until the lower colon has healed, and then it can be reversed. If the doctor needs to remove the entire lower colon, however, the colostomy may be permanent.            Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the operation, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Radiofrequency ablation      Radiofrequency ablation is the use of a special probe with tiny electrodes that kill cancer cells. Sometimes the probe is inserted directly through the skin and only local anesthesia is needed. In other cases, the probe is inserted through an incision in the abdomen. This is done in the hospital with general anesthesia.       Cryosurgery     Cryosurgery is a treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue. This type of treatment is also called cryotherapy.       Chemotherapy    Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).      Chemoembolization of the hepatic artery may be used to treat cancer that has spread to the liver. This involves blocking the hepatic artery (the main artery that supplies blood to the liver) and injecting anticancer drugs between the blockage and the liver. The livers arteries then deliver the drugs throughout the liver. Only a small amount of the drug reaches other parts of the body. The blockage may be temporary or permanent, depending on what is used to block the artery. The liver continues to receive some blood from the hepatic portal vein, which carries blood from the stomach and intestine.    The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    See Drugs Approved for Colon and Rectal Cancer for more information.       Radiation therapy    Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.       Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.     Types of targeted therapies used in the treatment of colon cancer include the following:            -  Monoclonal antibodies: Monoclonal antibodies are made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.                  -  Bevacizumab and ramucirumab are types of monoclonal antibodies that bind to a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.       -  Cetuximab and panitumumab are types of monoclonal antibodies that bind to a protein called epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on the surface of some types of cancer cells. This may stop cancer cells from growing and dividing.                -  Angiogenesis inhibitors: Angiogenesis inhibitors stop the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.                   -  Ziv-aflibercept is a vascular endothelial growth factor trap that blocks an enzyme needed for the growth of new blood vessels in tumors.       -  Regorafenib is used to treat colorectal cancer that has spread to other parts of the body and has not gotten better with other treatment. It blocks the action of certain proteins, including vascular endothelial growth factor. This may help keep cancer cells from growing and may kill them. It may also prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.                      See Drugs Approved for Colon and Rectal Cancer for more information.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

General information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.";Colon cancer treatment options depend on the stage of the cancer, the patient's overall health, and personal preferences. Common treatments include surgery to remove the cancerous portion of the colon, chemotherapy to kill cancer cells, radiation therapy to shrink tumors, targeted therapy to block the growth of cancer cells, and immunotherapy to boost the immune system's ability to fight cancer. In advanced stages, palliative care may be recommended to manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Regular screening, early detection, and lifestyle modifications like maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding smoking can help reduce the risk of colon cancer.;0.0;1941.0;92.0;0.158;0.039;0.092;0.723;-0.13;-0.288;0.034
190;gemini-pro;causes;What causes Sarcoidosis ?;What causes sarcoidosis? No one yet knows what causes sarcoidosis. It is thought by most scientists to be a disorder of the immune system, where the body's natural defense system malfunctions. Some physicians believe that sarcoidosis may result from a respiratory infection caused by a virus. Others suspect that exposure to toxins or allergens in the environment is to blame. It's also possible that some people have a genetic predisposition to developing sarcoidosis, which, when combined with an environmental trigger, produces the disease. Studies are ongoing to investigate the genetic and environmental components of this disease.;The exact cause of sarcoidosis is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues. Some potential triggers that may contribute to the development of sarcoidosis include genetic predisposition, environmental factors such as exposure to certain chemicals or infectious agents, and dysregulation of the immune system. It is not contagious and cannot be spread from person to person.;0.044;86.0;65.0;0.407;0.097;0.271;0.872;0.326;0.303;0.346
191;gemini-pro;treatment;What are the treatments for Richter syndrome ?;Are there any recent advancements in the treatment of Richter syndrome? Monoclonal antibodies (MABs) are a type of biological therapy. They are man-made proteins that target specific proteins on cancer cells. MABs are a fairly new treatment for cancer. Doctors often use the MAB drug called rituximab along with  chemotherapy and steroids to treat Richter syndrome. Researchers in a trial called the CHOP-OR study are studying whether a new biological therapy similar to rituximab can make CHOP chemotherapy work better. The new biological therapy drug is called ofatumumab (Arzerra). People who have been recently diagnosed with Richter syndrome can participate in this study. The study has two parts. First, patients have ofatumumab with CHOP chemotherapy to eliminate the lymphoma (this is called induction treatment). They then have more ofatumumab on its own to try to stop the lymphoma from coming back (this is called maintenance treatment). CLICK HERE to learn more about this study. Stem cell transplant is another way of treating Richter syndrome. While only a few people have undergone stem cell transplant for treatment of this disease, so far it has appeared to work quite well. The disease was controlled for longer than in people having normal dose chemotherapy. However, because stem cell transplants have serious side effects and complications, they are only suitable for a small group of people. More research is needed before we can truly find out how well stem cell treatment works for people with Richter syndrome. A recent study showed that a chemotherapy regimen called OFAR (a combination of oxaliplatin, fludarabine, cytarabine, and rituximab) had significant antileukemic activity in patients with Richter syndrome and relapsed/refractory CLL. Patients who underwent stem cell therapy as post-remission therapy had even more favorable outcomes.;Richter syndrome, a rare but aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), often requires a combination of treatment approaches. These may include chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, stem cell transplant, and radiation therapy. Chemotherapy involves the use of drugs to kill cancer cells, while targeted therapy focuses on specific molecules or proteins involved in cancer growth and survival. Immunotherapy harnesses the patient's own immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. Stem cell transplant replaces diseased bone marrow with healthy ones, while radiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays to kill cancer cells. The choice of treatment depends on various factors, including the patient's overall health, the stage of the disease, and the specific genetic characteristics of the cancer.;0.009;270.0;105.0;0.234;0.029;0.144;0.79;-0.152;-0.271;-0.031
192;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) pontocerebellar hypoplasia ?;"Pontocerebellar hypoplasia is a group of related conditions that affect the development of the brain. The term ""pontocerebellar"" refers to the pons and the cerebellum, which are the brain structures that are most severely affected in many forms of this disorder. The pons is located at the base of the brain in an area called the brainstem, where it transmits signals between the cerebellum and the rest of the brain. The cerebellum, which is located at the back of the brain, normally coordinates movement. The term ""hypoplasia"" refers to the underdevelopment of these brain regions.  Pontocerebellar hypoplasia also causes impaired growth of other parts of the brain, leading to an unusually small head size (microcephaly). This microcephaly is usually not apparent at birth but becomes noticeable as brain growth continues to be slow in infancy and early childhood.  Researchers have described at least ten types of pontocerebellar hypoplasia. All forms of this condition are characterized by impaired brain development, delayed development overall, problems with movement, and intellectual disability. The brain abnormalities are usually present at birth, and in some cases they can be detected before birth. Many children with pontocerebellar hypoplasia live only into infancy or childhood, although some affected individuals have lived into adulthood.  The two major forms of pontocerebellar hypoplasia are designated as type 1 (PCH1) and type 2 (PCH2). In addition to the brain abnormalities described above, PCH1 causes problems with muscle movement resulting from a loss of specialized nerve cells called motor neurons in the spinal cord, similar to another genetic disorder known as spinal muscular atrophy. Individuals with PCH1 also have very weak muscle tone (hypotonia), joint deformities called contractures, vision impairment, and breathing and feeding problems that are evident from early infancy.  Common features of PCH2 include a lack of voluntary motor skills (such as grasping objects, sitting, or walking), problems with swallowing (dysphagia), and an absence of communication, including speech. Affected children typically develop temporary jitteriness (generalized clonus) in early infancy, abnormal patterns of movement described as chorea or dystonia, and stiffness (spasticity). Many also have impaired vision and seizures.  The other forms of pontocerebellar hypoplasia, designated as type 3 (PCH3) through type 10 (PCH10), appear to be rare and have each been reported in only a small number of individuals. Because the different types have overlapping features, and some are caused by mutations in the same genes, researchers have proposed that the types be considered as a spectrum instead of distinct conditions.";Pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by the underdevelopment of the pons and cerebellum, two brain structures involved in coordination, balance, and motor control. This underdevelopment can lead to a wide range of symptoms, including hypotonia (low muscle tone), delayed development, intellectual disability, seizures, and difficulty with swallowing and breathing. PCH can be caused by genetic mutations, chromosomal abnormalities, or environmental factors such as exposure to toxins or infections during pregnancy. Treatment for PCH is supportive and focuses on managing the symptoms and improving the quality of life for individuals affected by the condition.;0.002;375.0;90.0;0.319;0.065;0.163;0.719;-0.006;-0.142;0.134
193;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency inherited ?;This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.;Yes, tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency is an inherited disorder. It is an autosomal recessive condition, meaning that both copies of the gene responsible for producing tyrosine hydroxylase must be mutated in order for the disorder to manifest. This means that the parents of an affected individual are typically unaffected carriers of the mutated gene. When two carriers have a child, there is a 25% chance that the child will inherit both mutated genes and develop the disorder.;0.083;44.0;65.0;0.439;0.171;0.317;0.656;0.239;0.324;0.154
194;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) 1q21.1 microdeletion ?;"1q21.1 microdeletion is a chromosomal change in which a small piece of chromosome 1 is deleted in each cell. The deletion occurs on the long (q) arm of the chromosome in a region designated q21.1. This chromosomal change increases the risk of delayed development, intellectual disability, physical abnormalities, and neurological and psychiatric problems. However, some people with a 1q21.1 microdeletion do not appear to have any associated features.  About 75 percent of all children with a 1q21.1 microdeletion have delayed development, particularly affecting the development of motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking. The intellectual disability and learning problems associated with this genetic change are usually mild.  Distinctive facial features can also be associated with 1q21.1 microdeletions. The changes are usually subtle and can include a prominent forehead; a large, rounded nasal tip; a long space between the nose and upper lip (philtrum); and a high, arched roof of the mouth (palate). Other common signs and symptoms of 1q21.1 microdeletions include an unusually small head (microcephaly), short stature, and eye problems such as clouding of the lenses (cataracts). Less frequently, 1q21.1 microdeletions are associated with heart defects, abnormalities of the genitalia or urinary system, bone abnormalities (particularly in the hands and feet), and hearing loss.  Neurological problems that have been reported in people with a 1q21.1 microdeletion include seizures and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Psychiatric or behavioral problems affect a small percentage of people with this genetic change. These include developmental conditions called autism spectrum disorders that affect communication and social interaction, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and sleep disturbances. Studies suggest that deletions of genetic material from the 1q21.1 region may also be risk factors for schizophrenia.  Some people with a 1q21.1 microdeletion do not have any of the intellectual, physical, or psychiatric features described above. In these individuals, the microdeletion is often detected when they undergo genetic testing because they have a relative with the chromosomal change. It is unknown why 1q21.1 microdeletions cause cognitive and physical changes in some individuals but few or no health problems in others, even within the same family.";1q21.1 microdeletion is a rare genetic disorder caused by the deletion of a small piece of genetic material from chromosome 1, specifically at region 1q21.1. This deletion can lead to a wide range of clinical features, including intellectual disability, developmental delay, speech and language difficulties, autism spectrum disorder, seizures, and distinctive facial features. The severity of the symptoms can vary among individuals, and some people with the deletion may only have mild or no symptoms at all. The diagnosis of 1q21.1 microdeletion is made through genetic testing, and there is currently no cure, but early intervention and support can help improve outcomes for affected individuals.;0.01;316.0;97.0;0.323;0.095;0.197;0.844;0.094;-0.036;0.228

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction.

196;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to Crigler-Najjar syndrome ?;Mutations in the UGT1A1 gene cause Crigler-Najjar syndrome. This gene provides instructions for making the bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (bilirubin-UGT) enzyme, which is found primarily in liver cells and is necessary for the removal of bilirubin from the body.  The bilirubin-UGT enzyme performs a chemical reaction called glucuronidation. During this reaction, the enzyme transfers a compound called glucuronic acid to unconjugated bilirubin, converting it to conjugated bilirubin. Glucuronidation makes bilirubin dissolvable in water so that it can be removed from the body.  Mutations in the UGT1A1 gene that cause Crigler-Najjar syndrome result in reduced or absent function of the bilirubin-UGT enzyme. People with CN1 have no enzyme function, while people with CN2 have less than 20 percent of normal function. The loss of bilirubin-UGT function decreases glucuronidation of unconjugated bilirubin. This toxic substance then builds up in the body, causing unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice.;Crigler-Najjar syndrome is a rare inherited disorder characterized by unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Genetic variations in the UGT1A1 gene, which encodes the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1, are responsible for the majority of cases. Mutations in the UGT1A1 gene impair the conjugation of bilirubin with glucuronic acid, leading to the accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood. This results in jaundice, a condition where the skin and whites of the eyes turn yellow. The severity of the syndrome depends on the specific mutation in the UGT1A1 gene.;0.037;132.0;68.0;0.313;0.098;0.209;0.803;0.156;0.088;0.224

Because most people do not develop noticeable signs or symptoms, treatment usually is not necessary. However, if treatment is needed, doctors will try to control the pain associated with the epithelial erosions. They may patch the eye to immobilize it, or prescribe lubricating eye drops and ointments. With treatment, these erosions usually heal within three days, although periodic flashes of pain may occur for several weeks thereafter. Other treatments include anterior corneal punctures to allow better adherence of cells; corneal scraping to remove eroded areas of the cornea and allow regeneration of healthy epithelial tissue; and use of the excimer laser to remove surface irregularities.

202;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) inherited thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency ?;Inherited thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency is a genetic condition that typically does not cause any health problems.  Thyroxine-binding globulin is a protein that carries hormones made or used by the thyroid gland, which is a butterfly-shaped tissue in the lower neck. Thyroid hormones play an important role in regulating growth, brain development, and the rate of chemical reactions in the body (metabolism). Most of the time, these hormones circulate in the bloodstream attached to thyroxine-binding globulin and similar proteins. If there is a shortage (deficiency) of thyroxine-binding globulin, the amount of circulating thyroid hormones is reduced.  Researchers have identified two forms of inherited thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency: the complete form (TBG-CD), which results in a total loss of thyroxine-binding globulin, and the partial form (TBG-PD), which reduces the amount of this protein or alters its structure. Neither of these conditions causes any problems with thyroid function. They are usually identified during routine blood tests that measure thyroid hormones.  Although inherited thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency does not cause any health problems, it can be mistaken for more serious thyroid disorders (such as hypothyroidism). Therefore, it is important to diagnose inherited thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency to avoid unnecessary treatments.;Inherited thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) deficiency is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by low levels of TBG, a protein responsible for transporting thyroid hormones in the blood. This can lead to increased levels of free thyroid hormones, which can cause symptoms such as anxiety, heat intolerance, weight loss, and heart palpitations. Treatment typically involves thyroid hormone replacement therapy to maintain normal thyroid hormone levels.;0.008;177.0;62.0;0.304;0.047;0.203;0.743;0.0;-0.091;0.091
203;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) collagen VI-related myopathy ?;"Collagen VI-related myopathy is a group of disorders that affect skeletal muscles (which are the muscles used for movement) and connective tissue (which provides strength and flexibility to the skin, joints, and other structures throughout the body). Most affected individuals have muscle weakness and joint deformities called contractures that restrict movement of the affected joints and worsen over time. Researchers have described several forms of collagen VI-related myopathy, which range in severity: Bethlem myopathy is the mildest, an intermediate form is moderate in severity, and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy is the most severe.  People with Bethlem myopathy usually have loose joints (joint laxity) and weak muscle tone (hypotonia) in infancy, but they develop contractures during childhood, typically in their fingers, wrists, elbows, and ankles. Muscle weakness can begin at any age but often appears in childhood to early adulthood. The muscle weakness is slowly progressive, with about two-thirds of affected individuals over age 50 needing walking assistance. Older individuals may develop weakness in respiratory muscles, which can cause breathing problems. Some people with this mild form of collagen VI-related myopathy have skin abnormalities, including small bumps called follicular hyperkeratosis on the arms and legs; soft, velvety skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet; and abnormal wound healing that creates shallow scars.  The intermediate form of collagen VI-related myopathy is characterized by muscle weakness that begins in infancy. Affected children are able to walk, although walking becomes increasingly difficult starting in early adulthood. They develop contractures in the ankles, elbows, knees, and spine in childhood. In some affected people, the respiratory muscles are weakened, requiring people to use a machine to help them breathe (mechanical ventilation), particularly during sleep.  People with Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy have severe muscle weakness beginning soon after birth. Some affected individuals are never able to walk and others can walk only with support. Those who can walk often lose the ability, usually in adolescence. Individuals with Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy develop contractures in their neck, hips, and knees, which further impair movement. There may be joint laxity in the fingers, wrists, toes, ankles, and other joints. Some affected individuals need continuous mechanical ventilation to help them breathe. As in Bethlem myopathy, some people with Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy have follicular hyperkeratosis; soft, velvety skin on the palms and soles; and abnormal wound healing.  Individuals with collagen VI-related myopathy often have signs and symptoms of multiple forms of this condition, so it can be difficult to assign a specific diagnosis. The overlap in disease features, in addition to their common cause, is why these once separate conditions are now considered part of the same disease spectrum.";Collagen VI-related myopathy is a heterogeneous group of rare, inherited muscle disorders caused by mutations in genes encoding components of collagen VI, a protein that provides structural support to muscles. This leads to the accumulation of abnormal collagen VI in muscles, resulting in progressive muscle weakness and wasting. Symptoms typically begin in childhood or adolescence and can include difficulty walking, climbing stairs, and lifting objects. Additional features may include joint contractures, scoliosis, and respiratory problems.

The three main causes of a solitary kidney are birth defects, surgical removal of a kidney, and kidney donation.  - In general, people with a solitary kidney lead full, healthy lives. However, some people are more likely to develop kidney disease.  - People with a solitary kidney should be tested regularly for the following signs of kidney damage:      - albuminuria    - decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR)    - high blood pressure    - People with a solitary kidney can protect their health by eating a nutritious diet, keeping their blood pressure at the appropriate level, and preventing injury to the working kidney.;In cases of solitary kidney, meticulous attention to maintaining kidney health is of utmost importance. Regular check-ups, monitoring of blood pressure and kidney function, and appropriate management of any underlying medical conditions that could potentially harm the kidney are essential. Preventive measures, such as avoiding nephrotoxic medications and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise, play a crucial role in preserving kidney function. Additionally, individuals with a solitary kidney should be cautious in engaging in high-impact sports or activities that pose a risk of abdominal trauma. In summary, individuals with a solitary kidney should prioritize kidney health through regular monitoring, preventive measures, and lifestyle modifications to minimize the risk of kidney damage and ensure long-term kidney function.;0.077;100.0;113.0;0.27;0.105;0.156;0.635;0.102;0.117;0.085
206;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to sialuria ?;Mutations in the GNE gene cause sialuria. The GNE gene provides instructions for making an enzyme found in cells and tissues throughout the body. This enzyme is involved in a chemical pathway that produces sialic acid, which is a simple sugar that attaches to the ends of more complex molecules on the surface of cells. By modifying these molecules, sialic acid influences a wide variety of cellular functions including cell movement (migration), attachment of cells to one another (adhesion), signaling between cells, and inflammation.  The enzyme produced from the GNE gene is carefully controlled to ensure that cells produce an appropriate amount of sialic acid. A feedback system shuts off the enzyme when no more sialic acid is needed. The mutations responsible for sialuria disrupt this feedback mechanism, resulting in an overproduction of sialic acid. This simple sugar builds up within cells and is excreted in urine. Researchers are working to determine how an accumulation of sialic acid in the body interferes with normal development in people with sialuria.;Sialuria, a rare metabolic disorder, is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme sialidase, which results in the accumulation of sialic acids in the urine and other body fluids. Genetic studies have identified several mutations in the gene encoding sialidase (NEU1) associated with sialuria. Common genetic changes include missense mutations, nonsense mutations, and splice site mutations within the NEU1 gene. These mutations lead to a non-functional or partially functional sialidase enzyme, impairing the breakdown of sialic acids from glycoproteins and glycolipids. As a result, sialic acids accumulate in various tissues and fluids, leading to the clinical manifestations and biochemical abnormalities characteristic of sialuria.;0.019;151.0;92.0;0.255;0.044;0.127;0.737;0.088;0.052;0.122

208;gemini-pro;symptoms;What are the symptoms of GM1 gangliosidosis ?;What are the signs and symptoms of GM1 gangliosidosis? There are three general types of GM1 gangliosidosis, which differ in severity but can have considerable overlap of signs and symptoms. Classic infantile (type 1) GM1 gangliosidosis is the most severe type, with onset shortly after birth (usually within 6 months of age). Affected infants typically appear normal until onset, but developmental regression (loss of acquired milestones) eventually occurs. Signs and symptoms may include neurodegeneration, seizures, liver and spleen enlargement, coarsening of facial features, skeletal irregularities, joint stiffness, a distended abdomen, muscle weakness, an exaggerated startle response to sound, and problems with gait (manner of walking). About half of people with this type develop cherry-red spots in the eye. Children may become deaf and blind by one year of age. Affected children typically do not live past 2 years of age. Juvenile (type 2) GM1 gangliosidosis is considered an intermediate form of the condition and may begin between the ages of 1 and 5. Features include ataxia, seizures, dementia, and difficulties with speech. This type progresses more slowly than type 1, but still causes decreased life expectancy (around mid-childhood or early adulthood). Adult (type 3) GM1 gangliosidosis may cause signs and symptoms to develop anywhere between the ages of 3 and 30. Affected people may have muscle atrophy, corneal clouding and dystonia. Non-cancerous skin blemishes may develop on the lower part of the trunk of the body. Adult GM1 is usually less severe and progresses more slowly than other forms of the condition.

This gene provides instructions for making a protein called lipin-2. Researchers believe that this protein may play a role in the processing of fats (lipid metabolism). However, no lipid abnormalities have been found with Majeed syndrome. Lipin-2 also may be involved in controlling inflammation and in cell division.  Mutations in the LPIN2 gene alter the structure and function of lipin-2. It is unclear how these genetic changes lead to bone disease, anemia, and inflammation of the skin in people with Majeed syndrome.;Majeed syndrome, also known as microcephaly, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, and dental abnormalities, is characterized by a combination of intellectual disability, short stature, distinctive facial features, dental anomalies, and hypogonadism.

Mutations in ANKRD11 result in functional disruptions of the protein, affecting its role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression. These genetic changes lead to abnormal development and function of various tissues and organs, contributing to the clinical features observed in Majeed syndrome.;0.088;84.0;84.0;0.317;0.115;0.2;0.676;0.119;0.177;0.06

However, tell your doctor or his or her staff about the medicines you're taking. Some medicines can affect EKG results.;The outlook for electrocardiogram (ECG) is generally positive. ECG is a non-invasive, painless test that provides valuable information about the heart's electrical activity. It can help diagnose a wide range of heart conditions, including arrhythmias, heart attacks, and cardiomyopathy. With early detection and treatment, many heart conditions can be managed or even reversed. Regular ECG monitoring can also help identify individuals at risk of developing heart problems, allowing for preventive measures to be taken. Advancements in ECG technology, such as wearable devices and AI-powered analysis, have further improved the accessibility and accuracy of ECG, making it an essential tool for maintaining heart health.;0.006;31.0;97.0;0.097;0.0;0.058;0.571;-0.078;-0.041;-0.117

219;gemini-pro;treatment;What are the treatments for Hypoplastic left heart syndrome ?;How might hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) be treated? Once the diagnosis of HLHS is made, the baby will be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. A breathing machine (ventilator) may be needed to help the baby breathe. A medicine called prostaglandin E1 is used to keep blood circulating to the body by keeping the ductus arteriosus open. These measures do not solve the problem and ultimately, the baby will require surgery. The first surgery, called the Norwood operation, occurs within the baby's first few days of life. Stage I of the Norwood procedure consists of building a new aorta by: Using the pulmonary valve and artery Connecting the hypoplastic old aorta and coronary arteries to the new aorta Removing the wall between the atria (atrial septum) Making an artificial connection from either the right ventricle or a body-wide artery to the pulmonary artery to maintain blood flow to the lungs (called a shunt) Afterwards, the baby usually goes home. The child will need to take daily medicines and be closely followed by a pediatric cardiologist, who will determine when the second stage of surgery should be done. Stage II of the operation is called the Glenn shunt or hemi-Fontan procedure. This procedure connects the major vein carrying blue blood from the top half of the body (the superior vena cava) directly to blood vessels to the lungs (pulmonary arteries) to get oxygen. The surgery is usually done when the child is 4 to 6 months of age. During stages I and II, the child may still appear somewhat blue (cyanotic).Stage III, the final step, is called the Fontan procedure. The rest of the veins that carry blue blood from the body (the inferior vena cava) are connected directly to the blood vessels to the lungs. The right ventricle now serves only as the pumping chamber for the body (no longer the lungs and the body). This surgery is usually performed when the baby is 18 months - 3 years old. After this final step, the baby is no longer blue. Some patients may need more surgeries in their 20s or 30s if they develop hard to control arrhythmias or other complications of the Fontan procedure. In some hospitals, heart transplantation is considered a better choice than the three-step surgery process.

227;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation ?;Leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation (commonly referred to as LBSL) is a progressive disorder that affects the brain and spinal cord. Leukoencephalopathy refers to abnormalities in the white matter of the brain, which is tissue containing nerve cell fibers (axons) that transmit nerve impulses.  Most affected individuals begin to develop movement problems during childhood or adolescence. However, in some individuals, these problems do not develop until adulthood. People with LBSL have abnormal muscle stiffness (spasticity) and difficulty with coordinating movements (ataxia). In addition, affected individuals lose the ability to sense the position of their limbs or vibrations with their limbs. These movement and sensation problems affect the legs more than the arms, making walking difficult. Most affected individuals eventually require wheelchair assistance, sometimes as early as their teens, although the age varies.  People with LBSL can have other signs and symptoms of the condition. Some affected individuals develop recurrent seizures (epilepsy), speech difficulties (dysarthria), learning problems, or mild deterioration of mental functioning. Some people with this disorder are particularly vulnerable to severe complications following minor head trauma, which may trigger a loss of consciousness, other reversible neurological problems, or fever.  Distinct changes in the brains of people with LBSL can be seen using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These characteristic abnormalities typically involve particular parts of the white matter of the brain and specific regions (called tracts) within the brain stem and spinal cord, especially the pyramidal tract and the dorsal column. In addition, most affected individuals have a high level of a substance called lactate in the white matter of the brain, which is identified using another test called magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).;Leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation (LBSL) is an incredibly rare and severe pediatric neurodegenerative disorder associated with mutations in the gene DARS2, encoding the mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. This condition is characterized by progressive neurological deterioration, typically presenting within the first few months of life. Key features include severe leukoencephalopathy, with extensive white matter abnormalities and atrophy in the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord, leading to profound neurological deficits, including intellectual disability, impaired motor function, and visual and hearing loss. Additionally, individuals with LBSL often exhibit elevated levels of lactate in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, indicating a metabolic dysfunction. The underlying mechanism involves mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired oxidative phosphorylation, and abnormal lipid metabolism, resulting in neuronal damage and progressive neurodegeneration.;0.038;257.0;116.0;0.246;0.077;0.164;0.672;0.075;-0.006;0.155

                    Childhood brain stem glioma is a disease in which benign (noncancer) or malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the brain stem.
                    Gliomas are tumors formed from glial cells. Glial cells in the brain hold nerve cells in place, bring food and oxygen to them, and help protect them from disease, such as infection.     The brain stem is the part of the brain connected to the spinal cord. It is in the lowest part of the brain, just above the back of the neck. The brain stem is the part of the brain that controls breathing, heart rate, and the nerves and muscles used in seeing, hearing, walking, talking, and eating. Most childhood brain stem gliomas are pontine gliomas, which form in a part of the brain stem called the pons.      Brain tumors are the third most common type of cancer in children.   This summary refers to the treatment of primary brain tumors (tumors that begin in the brain). Treatment for metastatic brain tumors, which are tumors formed by cancer cells that begin in other parts of the body and spread to the brain, is not discussed in this summary.    Brain tumors can occur in both children and adults; however, treatment for children may be different than treatment for adults.

                    Brain tumors may be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer).
                    Benign brain tumors grow and press on nearby areas of the brain. They rarely spread into other tissues. Malignant brain tumors are likely to grow quickly and spread into other brain tissue. When a tumor grows into or presses on an area of the brain, it may stop that part of the brain from working the way it should. Both benign and malignant brain tumors can cause signs and symptoms and need treatment.
                
                
                    There are two types of brain stem gliomas in children.
                    Childhood brain stem glioma is either a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) or a focal glioma.         - DIPG is a high-grade tumor that is fast-growing and spreads all through the brain stem. It is hard to treat and has a poor prognosis (chance of recovery). Children younger than 3 years diagnosed with DIPG may have a better prognosis than children who are 3 years and older.    - A focal glioma is slow-growing and is in one area of the brain stem. It is easier to treat than DIPG and has a better prognosis.";Childhood Brain Stem Glioma (BSG) is a rare and aggressive type of brain tumor that originates in the brain stem, a critical region of the brain responsible for vital functions such as breathing, heart rate, and consciousness. These tumors are challenging to treat due to their location and the difficulty in surgically removing them without causing severe neurological damage. Symptoms of BSG can vary depending on the tumor's size and location but may include difficulty with balance and coordination, vision problems, facial weakness, and difficulty swallowing. Treatment options for BSG may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or a combination of these approaches.;0.002;476.0;97.0;0.242;0.069;0.169;0.752;-0.109;-0.207;-0.011
230;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to common variable immune deficiency ?;"CVID is believed to result from mutations in genes that are involved in the development and function of immune system cells called B cells. B cells are specialized white blood cells that help protect the body against infection. When B cells mature, they produce special proteins called antibodies (also known as immunoglobulins). These proteins attach to foreign particles, marking them for destruction. Mutations in the genes associated with CVID result in dysfunctional B cells that cannot make sufficient amounts of antibodies.  People with CVID have a shortage (deficiency) of specific antibodies called immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin M (IgM). Some have a deficiency of all three antibodies, while others are lacking only IgG and IgA. A shortage of these antibodies makes it difficult for people with this disorder to fight off infections. Abnormal and deficient immune responses over time likely contribute to the increased cancer risk. In addition, vaccines for diseases such as measles and influenza do not provide protection for people with CVID because they cannot produce an antibody response.  Mutations in at least 10 genes have been associated with CVID. Approximately 10 percent of affected individuals have mutations in the TNFRSF13B gene. The protein produced from this gene plays a role in the survival and maturation of B cells and in the production of antibodies. TNFRSF13B gene mutations disrupt B cell function and antibody production, leading to immune dysfunction. Other genes associated with CVID are also involved in the function and maturation of immune system cells, particularly of B cells; mutations in these genes account for only a small percentage of cases.  In most cases of CVID, the cause is unknown, but it is likely a combination of genetic and environmental factors.";Common variable immune deficiency (CVID) is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by low levels of antibodies, leading to recurrent infections. Genetic studies have identified several genetic changes associated with CVID, which can be broadly grouped into two categories. The first category includes mutations in genes encoding components of the B cell receptor complex, such as the immunoglobulin heavy chain, immunoglobulin light chain, and B cell activating factor. These mutations impair B cell development and function, resulting in decreased antibody production. The second category includes mutations in genes involved in T cell function, such as the CD40 ligand, inducible T cell costimulator, and CD21. These mutations affect the interaction between T cells and B cells, leading to impaired B cell activation and antibody production. Additionally, mutations in genes encoding complement components and cytokine signaling molecules have also been implicated in CVID.;0.021;269.0;133.0;0.284;0.102;0.187;0.722;0.09;0.045;0.134

Leukoencephalopathy refers to abnormalities in the white matter of the brain, which is tissue containing nerve cell fibers (axons) that transmit nerve impulses.  Most affected individuals begin to develop movement problems during childhood or adolescence. However, in some individuals, these problems do not develop until adulthood. People with LBSL have abnormal muscle stiffness (spasticity) and difficulty with coordinating movements (ataxia). In addition, affected individuals lose the ability to sense the position of their limbs or vibrations with their limbs. These movement and sensation problems affect the legs more than the arms, making walking difficult. Most affected individuals eventually require wheelchair assistance, sometimes as early as their teens, although the age varies.  People with LBSL can have other signs and symptoms of the condition. Some affected individuals develop recurrent seizures (epilepsy), speech difficulties (dysarthria), learning problems, or mild deterioration of mental functioning. Some people with this disorder are particularly vulnerable to severe complications following minor head trauma, which may trigger a loss of consciousness, other reversible neurological problems, or fever.  Distinct changes in the brains of people with LBSL can be seen using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These characteristic abnormalities typically involve particular parts of the white matter of the brain and specific regions (called tracts) within the brain stem and spinal cord, especially the pyramidal tract and the dorsal column. In addition, most affected individuals have a high level of a substance called lactate in the white matter of the brain, which is identified using another test called magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).;;0.0;257.0;1.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.052;-0.429;-0.652;-0.187

248;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to Klippel-Feil syndrome ?;Mutations in the GDF6, GDF3, or MEOX1 gene can cause Klippel-Feil syndrome. These genes are involved in proper bone development. The protein produced from the GDF6 gene is necessary for the formation of bones and joints, including those in the spine. While the protein produced from the GDF3 gene is known to be involved in bone development, its exact role is unclear. The protein produced from the MEOX1 gene, called homeobox protein MOX-1, regulates the process that begins separating vertebrae from one another during early development.  GDF6 and GDF3 gene mutations that cause Klippel-Feil syndrome likely lead to reduced function of the respective proteins. MEOX1 gene mutations lead to a complete lack of homeobox protein MOX-1. Although the GDF6, GDF3, and homeobox protein MOX-1 proteins are involved in bone development, particularly formation of vertebrae, it is unclear how a shortage of one of these proteins leads to incomplete separation of the cervical vertebrae in people with Klippel-Feil syndrome.  When Klippel-Feil syndrome is a feature of another disorder, it is caused by mutations in genes involved in the other disorder.;Klippel-Feil syndrome, a rare congenital disorder characterized by the fusion of cervical vertebrae, is associated with mutations in several genes, including GDF6, GDF3, MEOX1, and EFNB1. These genes are involved in the development and segmentation of the vertebral column during embryonic development. Mutations in these genes can disrupt the normal signaling pathways, leading to the abnormal fusion of vertebrae, which is the hallmark of Klippel-Feil syndrome. Additionally, mutations in genes encoding components of the NOTCH signaling pathway, such as NOTCH1 and RBPJ, have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of Klippel-Feil syndrome.;0.042;162.0;83.0;0.356;0.107;0.237;0.745;0.209;0.153;0.264
249;gemini-pro;treatment;What are the treatments for Gardner-Diamond syndrome ?;How might Gardner-Diamond syndrome be treated? There is no specific treatment for Gardner-Diamond syndrome (GDS). It has been suggested that psychiatric treatment (including psychotherapy) is the only reasonable therapeutic option. In some people, psychiatric medications for mental illness have helped to improve the symptoms. For example, in a person with GDS and an underlying personality disorder, medications used to treat the personality disorder may help with the symptoms of GDS. Due to the presumed psychological nature of the disease, placebo effect has been used successfully to ease the severity of symptoms. It has been proposed that certain medications used to alter the tonus of the capillaries (how they contract), the permeability of the vessels, and/or the flowing properties of the blood may be useful for some people. Symptomatic therapy may be helpful for severe, general symptoms. Several approaches including antihistamines, corticosteroids, antidepressants, hormones, and vitamins have had variable success.;Gardner-Diamond syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by soft tissue tumors and multiple intestinal polyps, has no cure, but treatments are available to manage its symptoms and complications. These treatments may include surgical removal of polyps and tumors, radiation therapy to shrink tumors, and chemotherapy to kill cancer cells. Regular monitoring and screening are crucial to detect and treat any new or recurring lesions promptly. Additionally, genetic counseling and family planning options can be discussed to help manage the risk of passing the condition to future generations.;0.008;134.0;85.0;0.182;0.01;0.104;0.507;-0.022;-0.051;0.003

Conservative treatments may include compression stockings, sclerotherapy (injection of a solution to shrink abnormal blood vessels), and physical therapy. Surgical interventions such as vascular surgery, bone lengthening, or amputation may be necessary in severe cases. Medications may also be prescribed to manage pain, reduce swelling, or prevent blood clots. Additionally, lifestyle modifications such as maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding prolonged standing or sitting, and elevating affected limbs can help manage symptoms.

251;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to familial HDL deficiency ?;Mutations in the ABCA1 gene or the APOA1 gene cause familial HDL deficiency. The proteins produced from these genes work together to remove cholesterol and phospholipids from cells.  The ABCA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that removes cholesterol and phospholipids from cells by moving them across the cell membrane. The movement of these substances across the membrane is enhanced by another protein called apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), which is produced by the APOA1 gene. Once outside the cell, the cholesterol and phospholipids combine with apoA-I to form HDL. ApoA-I also triggers a reaction that converts cholesterol to a form that can be fully integrated into HDL and transported through the bloodstream.  ABCA1 gene mutations and some APOA1 gene mutations prevent the release of cholesterol and phospholipids from cells. Other mutations in the APOA1 gene reduce the protein's ability to stimulate the conversion of cholesterol. These ABCA1 and APOA1 gene mutations decrease the amount of cholesterol or phospholipids available to form HDL, resulting in low levels of HDL in the blood. A shortage (deficiency) of HDL is believed to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.;Familial high-density lipoprotein (HDL) deficiency is a genetic disorder characterized by low levels of HDL cholesterol in the blood. The genetic changes associated with this condition vary, but commonly involve mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in HDL metabolism, such as the apolipoprotein A-I (APOA1), apolipoprotein A-II (APOA2), lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) genes. These mutations can disrupt the normal function of the respective proteins, leading to impaired HDL assembly, secretion, or clearance, ultimately resulting in low HDL levels in the blood.;0.025;163.0;79.0;0.34;0.084;0.204;0.729;0.022;-0.016;0.058
252;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) cryptogenic cirrhosis ?;Cryptogenic cirrhosis is a condition that impairs liver function. People with this condition develop irreversible liver disease caused by scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), typically in mid- to late adulthood.  The liver is a part of the digestive system that helps break down food, store energy, and remove waste products, including toxins. Minor damage to the liver can be repaired by the body. However, severe or long-term damage can lead to the replacement of normal liver tissue with scar tissue.  In the early stages of cryptogenic cirrhosis, people often have no symptoms because the liver has enough normal tissue to function. Signs and symptoms become apparent as more of the liver is replaced by scar tissue. Affected individuals can experience fatigue, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, nausea, swelling (edema), enlarged blood vessels, and yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice).  People with cryptogenic cirrhosis may develop high blood pressure in the vein that supplies blood to the liver (portal hypertension). Cryptogenic cirrhosis can lead to type 2 diabetes, although the mechanism is unclear. Some people with cryptogenic cirrhosis develop cancer of the liver (hepatocellular cancer).;Cryptogenic cirrhosis is a form of cirrhosis with an unknown cause. It is the second most common type of cirrhosis after hepatitis C virus (HCV) related cirrhosis, accounting for up to 20% of all cases. It is characterized by the presence of scarring and fibrosis in the liver, leading to impaired liver function. The exact cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis is unknown, but several factors are thought to contribute, including autoimmune disorders, genetic factors, exposure to toxins, and drug reactions. Symptoms of cryptogenic cirrhosis can range from mild to severe and may include fatigue, abdominal pain, swelling in the legs and ankles, yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), easy bruising or bleeding, loss of appetite, weight loss, and difficulty concentrating. Treatment for cryptogenic cirrhosis typically involves managing the symptoms and complications of the disease, as there is no cure.;0.071;172.0;129.0;0.342;0.101;0.166;0.794;0.148;0.109;0.185

Some studies suggest that individuals with a family history of chronic hiccups may be more likely to experience them, indicating a potential genetic component. However, the exact genetic factors involved, if any, are yet to be fully understood. Additionally, environmental and lifestyle factors, such as stress, certain medications, and underlying medical conditions, can also contribute to the development of chronic hiccups. Therefore, while there may be a genetic predisposition, the inheritance of chronic hiccups is not fully established.;0.036;24.0;88.0;0.286;0.097;0.167;0.894;0.12;0.232;0.011
255;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is Ohdo syndrome, Maat-Kievit-Brunner type inherited ?;This condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. The MED12 gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder.  Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. Females with only one altered copy of the gene in each cell are called carriers. They do not usually experience health problems related to the condition, but they can pass the mutation to their children. Sons who inherit the altered gene will have the condition, while daughters who inherit the altered gene will be carriers.  A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.;Ohdo syndrome, Maat-Kievit-Brunner type is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, with high penetrance but variable expressivity. This means that if one parent has the condition, each of their children has a 50% chance of also having it. The severity of the symptoms can vary from person to person, even within the same family. Ohdo syndrome is caused by mutations in the POLR3A gene, which codes for a protein involved in DNA transcription. These mutations can be inherited from a parent or can occur sporadically.;0.012;152.0;76.0;0.304;0.029;0.145;0.592;-0.099;-0.077;-0.124
256;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is Prothrombin thrombophilia inherited ?;"How is prothrombin thrombophilia inherited? Prothrombin thrombophilia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. For this condition, this means that having one mutated copy of the disease-causing gene (F2) in each cell may be sufficient to cause signs or symptoms of the condition. The mutation in the F2 gene that causes prothrombin thrombophilia is called 20210G>A (also called the 20210G>A allele). An individual can be heterozygous (having the mutation in only one copy of the F2 gene) or homozygous (having a mutation in both copies of the F2 gene). Heterozygosity results in an increased risk for thrombosis; homozygosity results in more severe thrombophilia and/or increased risk for thrombosis. All individuals reported to date with prothrombin thrombophilia who are heterozygous for the 20210G>A allele have had an affected parent. Because of the relatively high prevalence of this allele in the general population, occasionally one parent is homozygous or both parents are heterozygous for this allele. When an individual who is heterozygous for the 20210G>A allele has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) risk to inherit that allele and also be heterozygous. An individual who is homozygous will always pass one of the 20210G>A alleles to each of his/her children. If two heterozygotes have children together, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to be homozygous (having 2 mutated copies), a 50% risk to be heterozygous like each parent, and a 25% risk to inherit 2 normal copies of the F2 gene.";Yes, Prothrombin thrombophilia is inherited. It is typically inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, meaning that only one copy of the mutated gene is necessary to cause the disorder. The mutation responsible for Prothrombin thrombophilia is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the prothrombin gene. This SNP causes a change in the amino acid sequence of prothrombin, which leads to the production of a prothrombin molecule that is more resistant to degradation. As a result, individuals with Prothrombin thrombophilia have higher levels of prothrombin in their blood, which increases their risk of developing blood clots.;0.022;220.0;84.0;0.331;0.07;0.252;0.768;0.075;-0.112;0.275

The incidence of EBS varies widely depending on the specific subtype and population studied. Overall, it is estimated that EBS affects approximately 1 in 50,000 individuals worldwide. However, certain subtypes, such as Dowling-Meara EBS, may have a higher prevalence in specific regions or populations. The rarity of EBS makes it challenging to obtain precise estimates of the number of people affected, and the actual prevalence may be underreported due to variations in diagnostic criteria and limited access to healthcare services in some areas.;0.026;29.0;93.0;0.271;0.067;0.208;0.841;0.165;0.339;-0.0
258;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Glaucoma ?;Glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve. It is a leading cause of blindness in the United States. It usually happens when the fluid pressure inside the eyes slowly rises, damaging the optic nerve. Often there are no symptoms at first. Without treatment, people with glaucoma will slowly lose their peripheral, or side vision. They seem to be looking through a tunnel. Over time, straight-ahead vision may decrease until no vision remains.    A comprehensive eye exam can tell if you have glaucoma. People at risk should get eye exams at least every two years. They include       -  African Americans over age 40    -  People over age 60, especially Mexican Americans    -  People with a family history of glaucoma       There is no cure, but glaucoma can usually be controlled. Early treatment can help protect your eyes against vision loss. Treatments usually include prescription eyedrops and/or surgery.    NIH: National Eye Institute;Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, which connects the eye to the brain. The most common type is open-angle glaucoma, where the fluid that circulates inside the eye (aqueous humor) does not drain properly, causing pressure to build up inside the eye. This pressure damages the optic nerve, leading to vision loss and blindness if left untreated. Other types of glaucoma include angle-closure glaucoma, where the iris blocks the drainage of aqueous humor, and secondary glaucoma, caused by another eye condition or medical condition. Early detection through regular eye exams is crucial as glaucoma often has no noticeable symptoms in its early stages. Treatments aim to reduce eye pressure and prevent further damage to the optic nerve.;0.035;142.0;111.0;0.316;0.058;0.203;0.784;0.157;0.092;0.22

260;gemini-pro;symptoms;What are the symptoms of Craniometaphyseal dysplasia, autosomal recessive type ?;What are the signs and symptoms of Craniometaphyseal dysplasia, autosomal recessive type? Bone overgrowth in the head causes many of the signs and symptoms of craniometaphyseal dysplasia. Affected individuals typically have distinctive facial features such as a wide nasal bridge, a prominent forehead, wide-set eyes (hypertelorism), and a prominent jaw. Excessive new bone formation (hyperostosis) in the jaw can delay teething (dentition) or result in absent teeth. Infants with this condition may have breathing or feeding problems caused by narrow nasal passages. In severe cases, abnormal bone growth can compress the nerves that emerge from the brain and extend to various areas of the head and neck (cranial nerves). Compression of the cranial nerves can lead to paralyzed facial muscles (facial nerve palsy), blindness, or deafness. The x-rays of individuals with craniometaphyseal dysplasia show unusually shaped long bones, particularly the large bones in the legs. The ends of these bones (metaphyses) are wider and appear less dense in people with this condition. The symptoms seen in autosomal recessive craniometaphyseal dysplasia are typically more severe than those seen in the autosomal dominant form. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Craniometaphyseal dysplasia, autosomal recessive type.

Instead, the symptoms are due to nerve or muscle problems that affect the movement of food, fluid, and air through the intestines.  - Intestinal pseudo-obstruction symptoms may include abdominal swelling or bloating, also called distension; abdominal pain; nausea; vomiting; constipation; and diarrhea. Over time, the condition can cause malnutrition, bacterial overgrowth in the intestines, and weight loss.  - To diagnose intestinal pseudo-obstruction, a health care provider may suggest the person consult a gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseases. A health care provider will perform a physical exam; take a complete medical history, imaging studies, and a biopsy; and perform blood tests. A health care provider may order other tests to confirm the diagnosis.  - A health care provider will treat intestinal pseudo-obstruction with nutritional support, medications, and, in some cases, decompression. Rarely, a person will need surgery. If an illness, a medication, or both cause intestinal pseudo-obstruction, a health care provider will treat the underlying illness, stop the medication, or do both. A health care provider may recommend small intestine transplantation when all other treatments have failed.";"Intestinal pseudo-obstruction, a condition characterized by symptoms similar to mechanical obstruction but without a physical blockage, requires a multifaceted treatment approach:

1. Conservative Management:
   - Fluid and Electrolyte Balance: Maintain adequate hydration and correct electrolyte imbalances.
   - Nutritional Support: Provide nutritional support with a low-residue diet or elemental diet, as tolerated.
   - Medications: Administer medications to relieve symptoms, such as anticholinergics to reduce bowel spasms and laxatives to promote bowel movements.

2. Decompression:
   - Nasogastric Tube: Insert a nasogastric tube to relieve gastric distention and prevent aspiration.
   - Abdominal Drainage: Perform abdominal paracentesis or peritoneal drainage to relieve abdominal distension and improve intestinal motility.

3. Surgery:
   - Adhesiolysis: Surgical removal of adhesions that may be causing pseudo-obstruction.
   - Resection and Bypass: In severe cases, surgical resection of affected bowel segments and creation of a bypass may be necessary.

4. Long-Term Management:
   - Dietary Modifications: Follow a long-term diet plan that is low in fiber and easy to digest.
   - Medications: Continue medications to prevent recurrence of symptoms.
   - Regular Monitoring: Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.";0.011;183.0;165.0;0.249;0.019;0.107;0.743;-0.075;-0.03;-0.122

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.;Trichothiodystrophy photosensitive is a rare genetic disorder characterized by photosensitivity, brittle hair, and intellectual disability. The symptoms of the photosensitivity can include severe sunburn, blistering, and skin discoloration after even brief exposure to sunlight. Brittle hair is a common symptom and can lead to hair loss. Intellectual disability can range from mild to severe and can affect a person's ability to learn, think, and solve problems. Other symptoms can include short stature, delayed growth, and distinctive facial features. Treatment for Trichothiodystrophy photosensitive is supportive and may include protective clothing, sunscreen, and special education services.;0.007;239.0;89.0;0.206;0.047;0.147;0.691;-0.159;-0.3;-0.014

- Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection  - damage to the stomach lining, which leads to reactive gastritis  - an autoimmune response
                
H. pylori infection. H. pylori is a type of bacteriaorganisms that may cause an infection. H. pylori infection
                
- causes most cases of gastritis  - typically causes nonerosive gastritis  - may cause acute or chronic gastritis
                
H. pylori infection is common, particularly in developing countries, and the infection often begins in childhood. Many people who are infected with H. pylori never have any symptoms. Adults are more likely to show symptoms when symptoms do occur.
                
Researchers are not sure how the H. pylori infection spreads, although they think contaminated food, water, or eating utensils may transmit the bacteria. Some infected people have H. pylori in their saliva, which suggests that infection can spread through direct contact with saliva or other body fluids.
                
More information about Peptic Ulcer Disease and H. pylori is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Peptic Ulcer Disease.
                
Damage to the stomach lining, which leads to reactive gastritis. Some people who have damage to the stomach lining can develop reactive gastritis.
                
Reactive gastritis
                
- may be acute or chronic  - may cause erosions  - may cause little or no inflammation
                
Reactive gastritis may also be called reactive gastropathy when it causes little or no inflammation.
                
The causes of reactive gastritis may include
                
- nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), a type of over-the-counter medication. Aspirin and ibuprofen are common types of NSAIDs.  - drinking alcohol.  - using cocaine.  - exposure to radiation or having radiation treatments.  - reflux of bile from the small intestine into the stomach. Bile reflux may occur in people who have had part of their stomach removed.  - a reaction to stress caused by traumatic injuries, critical illness, severe burns, and major surgery. This type of reactive gastritis is called stress gastritis.
                
An autoimmune response. In autoimmune gastritis, the immune system attacks healthy cells in the stomach lining. The immune system normally protects people from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. Autoimmune gastritis is chronic and typically nonerosive.
                
Less common causes of gastritis may include
                
- Crohn's disease, which causes inflammation and irritation of any part of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.  - sarcoidosis, a disease that causes inflammation that will not go away. The chronic inflammation causes tiny clumps of abnormal tissue to form in various organs in the body. The disease typically starts in the lungs, skin, and lymph nodes.  - allergies to food, such as cow's milk and soy, especially in children.  - infections with viruses, parasites, fungi, and bacteria other than H. pylori, typically in people with weakened immune systems.";Gastritis is primarily caused by inflammation of the stomach lining, often resulting from infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori, excessive alcohol consumption, regular use of certain medications (such as aspirin or ibuprofen), autoimmune disorders, Crohn's disease, or stress. Additionally, consuming spicy or acidic foods, smoking, and radiation therapy can contribute to the development of gastritis. In some cases, gastritis may also stem from pernicious anemia, which hinders the body's ability to absorb vitamin B12, leading to inflammation in the stomach lining.;0.001;407.0;76.0;0.268;0.053;0.126;0.684;-0.08;-0.225;0.07

It is a leading cause of blindness among people with diabetes. High blood sugar levels can damage the blood vessels in the retina, causing them to leak fluid and blood. This can lead to swelling, scarring, and the growth of new, weak blood vessels. These changes can interfere with the retina's ability to send signals to the brain, resulting in vision problems and potentially leading to blindness.

NINDS supported research on brain circuitry was critical to the development of DBS.
                
Researchers are continuing to study DBS and to develop ways of improving it. A two-part study funded by the NINDS and the Department of Veterans Affairs first compared bilateral DBS to best medical therapy, including medication adjustment and physical therapy. Bilateral DBS showed overall superiority to best medical therapy at improving motor symptoms and quality of life. The second part of the study, involving nearly 300 patients, compared subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS to globus pallidus interna (GPI) DBS. The two groups reported similar improvements in motor control and quality of life in scores on the Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale. On a variety of neuropsychological tests, there were no significant differences between the two groups. However, the STN DBS group experienced a greater decline on a test of visuomotor processing speed, which measures how quickly someone thinks and acts on information. Also, the STN DBS group had slight worsening on a standard assessment of depression, while the GPI DBS group had slight improvement on the same test. The importance of these two differences is not clear, and will be scrutinized in follow-up research.

Most kidney diseases attack the nephrons. This damage may leave kidneys unable to remove wastes. Causes can include genetic problems, injuries, or medicines. You are at greater risk for kidney disease if you have diabetes, high blood pressure, or a close family member with kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease damages the nephrons slowly over several years.

                    Myelodysplastic syndromes are a group of cancers in which immature blood cells in the bone marrow do not mature or become healthy blood cells.
                    In a healthy person, the bone marrow makes blood stem cells (immature cells) that become mature blood cells over time.     A blood stem cell may become a lymphoid stem cell or a myeloid stem cell. A lymphoid stem cell becomes a white blood cell. A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells:         -  Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body.    -  Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding.     - White blood cells that fight infection and disease.          In a patient with a myelodysplastic syndrome, the blood stem cells (immature cells) do not become mature red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets in the bone marrow. These immature blood cells, called blasts, do not work the way they should and either die in the bone marrow or soon after they go into the blood. This leaves less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets to form in the bone marrow. When there are fewer healthy blood cells, infection, anemia, or easy bleeding may occur.
                
                
                    The different types of myelodysplastic syndromes are diagnosed based on certain changes in the blood cells and bone marrow.
                    -  Refractory anemia: There are too few red blood cells in the blood and the patient has anemia. The number of white blood cells and platelets is normal.    -  Refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts: There are too few red blood cells in the blood and the patient has anemia. The red blood cells have too much iron inside the cell. The number of white blood cells and platelets is normal.    -  Refractory anemia with excess blasts: There are too few red blood cells in the blood and the patient has anemia. Five percent to 19% of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts. There also may be changes to the white blood cells and platelets. Refractory anemia with excess blasts may progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). See the PDQ Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment summary for more information.    -  Refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia: There are too few of at least two types of blood cells (red blood cells, platelets, or white blood cells). Less than 5% of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts and less than 1% of the cells in the blood are blasts. If red blood cells are affected, they may have extra iron. Refractory cytopenia may progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).     -  Refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia: There are too few of one type of blood cell (red blood cells, platelets, or white blood cells). There are changes in 10% or more of two other types of blood cells. Less than 5% of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts and less than 1% of the cells in the blood are blasts.     -  Unclassifiable myelodysplastic syndrome: The numbers of blasts in the bone marrow and blood are normal, and the disease is not one of the other myelodysplastic syndromes.     -  Myelodysplastic syndrome associated with an isolated del(5q) chromosome abnormality: There are too few red blood cells in the blood and the patient has anemia. Less than 5% of the cells in the bone marrow and blood are blasts. There is a specific change in the chromosome.    -   Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML): See the PDQ summary on Myelodysplastic/ Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Treatment for more information.";Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of blood cancers that affect the blood-forming cells in the bone marrow. In MDS, the bone marrow produces abnormal blood cells, which can lead to anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen to the tissues. Neutropenia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy white blood cells to fight infection.

275;gemini-pro;causes;What causes Tetrasomy X ?;What causes tetrasomy X? Tetrasomy X is usually caused by a random error in the formation of an egg cell (before pregnancy). In some cases, it may be due to inheriting three X chromosomes from the mother and one X chromosome from the father. In other cases, it may be due to inheriting all four X chromosomes from the mother. During the normal formation of egg cells, each egg cell contains one X chromosome to pass on to offspring. However, errors in cell division can cause an egg cell to have three or four X chromosomes, instead of one. If an egg cell with the extra X chromosomes is fertilized by a sperm cell with one X chromosome, the resulting embryo will have these extra chromosomes. Rarely, tetrasomy X may be caused by an error in cell division that occurs after an egg is fertilized, or by the presence of extra X chromosomes in some of the mother's cells.;Tetrasomy X, also known as 48, XXXX syndrome, is a chromosomal condition that occurs when a female has four copies of the X chromosome instead of the typical two. The exact cause of Tetrasomy X is not fully understood, but it is thought to be the result of an error during cell division called nondisjunction, which can occur during either meiosis (the process of forming eggs and sperm) or mitosis (the process of cell division after conception). In the case of Tetrasomy X, nondisjunction results in an extra copy of the X chromosome being present in the egg or sperm, which then leads to the development of an embryo with four X chromosomes.;0.032;143.0;98.0;0.415;0.08;0.222;0.769;0.157;0.167;0.145
276;gemini-pro;exams and tests;How to diagnose Extragonadal Germ Cell Tumors ?;Imaging and blood tests are used to detect (find) and diagnose extragonadal germ cell tumors. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. The testicles may be checked for lumps, swelling, or pain. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   Serum tumor marker test : A procedure in which a sample of blood is examined to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called tumor markers. The following three tumor markers are used to detect extragonadal germ cell tumor:                -  Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP).      -  Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG).       -  Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).         Blood levels of the tumor markers help determine if the tumor is a seminoma or nonseminoma.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. Sometimes a CT scan and a PET scan are done at the same time. A PET scan is a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. When a PET scan and CT scan are done at the same time, it is called a PET-CT.    -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The type of biopsy used depends on where the extragonadal germ cell tumor is found.                -  Excisional biopsy : The removal of an entire lump of tissue.      -  Incisional biopsy : The removal of part of a lump or sample of tissue.      -  Core biopsy : The removal of tissue using a wide needle.      -  Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy : The removal of tissue or fluid using a thin needle.;Extragonadal germ cell tumors (EGCTs) are a rare group of cancers that develop from primordial germ cells outside the gonads. Diagnosis of EGCTs involves a combination of clinical examination, imaging tests, laboratory tests, and biopsy. Imaging tests such as CT scans, MRI scans, and ultrasound can help identify the location and extent of the tumor. Laboratory tests may include blood tests to assess tumor markers, such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which can be elevated in some cases of EGCTs. A biopsy, which involves removing a small tissue sample from the tumor, is essential for confirming the diagnosis and determining the type of EGCT. Additional tests may be recommended to evaluate the spread of the disease, such as bone scans or PET scans. Early diagnosis and accurate staging are crucial for determining the appropriate treatment plan and improving patient outcomes.;0.01;402.0;130.0;0.29;0.073;0.174;0.618;-0.073;-0.204;0.063
277;gemini-pro;symptoms;What are the symptoms of Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ?;"What are the symptoms of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis? Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is characterized by an abnormal curvature of the spine (usually in an elongated ""S"" or ""C"" shape), along with twisted or rotated bones of the spine. Mild scoliosis generally does not cause pain, problems with movement, or difficulty breathing. It may only be diagnosed if it is noticed during a regular physical examination or a scoliosis screening at school. The most common signs of the condition include a tilt or unevenness (asymmetry) in the shoulders, hips, or waist, or having one leg that appears longer than the other. A small percentage of affected children develop more severe, pronounced spinal curvature. Scoliosis can occur as a feature of other conditions, including a variety of genetic syndromes. However, adolescent idiopathic scoliosis typically occurs by itself, without signs and symptoms affecting other parts of the body.";Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a complex condition characterized by an abnormal curvature of the spine that typically develops during adolescence. Common symptoms of AIS include uneven shoulders, a prominent shoulder blade, one hip appearing higher than the other, a rib hump on one side of the back, and a waist that appears uneven. In severe cases, AIS can lead to pain, difficulty breathing, and heart problems. Regular monitoring and treatment, such as bracing or surgery, can help manage the condition and prevent further curvature.;0.06;128.0;76.0;0.43;0.112;0.266;0.808;0.184;0.14;0.226

For mild cases, regular monitoring and lifestyle modifications, such as avoiding strenuous activities and staying hydrated, may be sufficient. In moderate to severe cases, blood transfusions may be necessary to replenish red blood cells and reduce the risk of complications. Splenectomy, the surgical removal of the spleen, is commonly performed to eliminate the primary site of red blood cell destruction and improve the lifespan of healthy red blood cells. Additionally, medications like folic acid supplements and hydroxyurea may be used to stimulate red blood cell production and reduce hemolysis. In some cases, bone marrow transplantation may be considered as a last resort for patients with severe, life-threatening complications.;0.01;78.0;117.0;0.098;0.025;0.066;0.521;-0.23;-0.208;-0.255
279;gemini-pro;frequency;How many people are affected by von Willebrand disease ?;Von Willebrand disease is estimated to affect 1 in 100 to 10,000 individuals. Because people with mild signs and symptoms may not come to medical attention, it is thought that this condition is underdiagnosed. Most researchers agree that von Willebrand disease is the most common genetic bleeding disorder.;Von Willebrand disease (VWD) affects approximately 1% of the global population, making it the most common inherited bleeding disorder. This means that about 75 million people worldwide are affected by VWD. The prevalence of VWD varies across different regions and ethnic groups, with certain populations having a higher incidence rate than others. For instance, in some parts of Europe, the prevalence of VWD is estimated to be as high as 1.3%. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for individuals with VWD to ensure appropriate management and treatment, which can help prevent bleeding complications and improve overall quality of life.;0.036;47.0;94.0;0.336;0.09;0.159;0.819;0.096;0.212;-0.019
280;gemini-pro;treatment;What are the treatments for Hemochromatosis ?;"Treatments for hemochromatosis include therapeutic phlebotomy (fleh-BOT-o-me), iron chelation (ke-LAY-shun) therapy, dietary changes, and treatment for complications.
                
The goals of treating hemochromatosis include:
                
Reducing the amount of iron in your body to normal levels
                
Preventing or delaying organ damage from iron overload
                
Treating complications of the disease
                
Maintaining a normal amount of iron in your body for the rest of your life
                
Therapeutic Phlebotomy
                
Therapeutic phlebotomy is a procedure that removes blood (and iron) from your body. A needle is inserted into a vein, and your blood flows through an airtight tube into a sterile container or bag.
                
The process is similar to donating blood; it can be done at blood donation centers, hospital donation centers, or a doctor's office.
                
In the first stage of treatment, about 1 pint of blood is removed once or twice a week. After your iron levels return to normal, you may continue phlebotomy treatments. However, you may need them less oftentypically every 24 months.
                
As long as treatment continues, which often is for the rest of your life, you'll need frequent blood tests to check your iron levels.
                
Iron Chelation Therapy
                
Iron chelation therapy uses medicine to remove excess iron from your body. This treatment is a good option for people who can't have routine blood removal.
                
The medicine used in iron chelation therapy is either injected or taken orally (by mouth). Injected iron chelation therapy is done at a doctor's office. Oral iron chelation therapy can be done at home.
                
Dietary Changes
                
Your doctor may suggest that you change your diet if you have hemochromatosis. You may be advised to:
                
Avoid taking iron, including iron pills, iron injections, or multivitamins that contain iron.
                
Limit your intake of vitamin C. Vitamin C helps your body absorb iron from food. Talk with your doctor about how much vitamin C is safe for you.
                
Avoid uncooked fish and shellfish. Some fish and shellfish contain bacteria that can cause infections in people who have chronic diseases, such as hemochromatosis.
                
Limit alcohol intake. Drinking alcohol increases the risk of liver disease. It also can make existing liver disease worse.
                
Treatment for Complications
                
Your doctor may prescribe other treatments as needed for complications such as liver disease, heart problems, or diabetes.";Hemochromatosis, an iron overload disorder, can be managed through various treatments. Phlebotomy, a process similar to blood donation, is the primary treatment. Regular removal of blood helps reduce iron levels. Medications, such as deferoxamine, deferiprone, and deferasirox, can also be used to remove excess iron from the body. If the condition is severe, liver transplantation may be considered as a last resort. Regular monitoring of iron levels and liver function is necessary to track progress and adjust treatment accordingly. Lifestyle modifications, including avoiding iron-rich foods and alcohol, can also contribute to managing hemochromatosis.;0.005;353.0;87.0;0.283;0.068;0.197;0.787;-0.057;-0.151;0.037
281;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Paget's Disease of Bone ?;Enlarged and Misshapen Bones Paget's disease of bone causes affected bones to become enlarged and misshapen. Our bones are living tissue, and our bodies are constantly breaking down old bone and replacing it with new bone. In Paget's disease, however, old bone is broken down and replaced at a faster rate than normal. The new bone is larger and weaker than normal bone. Paget's disease can occur in any bone in the body, but it is most common in the pelvis, spine, skull, and leg bones. It may occur in just one bone or in several bones, but it does not affect the entire skeleton or spread from affected bones to normal bones. Common symptoms include pain, misshapen bones, and a greater chance of broken bones. Complications Paget's disease can also lead to complications, such as arthritis, headaches, hearing loss, or nervous system problems, depending on which bones are affected. If not treated, Paget's disease can reduce a person's ability to perform activities of daily living, thereby reducing quality of life. Although it is the second most common bone disease after osteoporosis, Paget's disease is still uncommon. According to Bone Health and Osteoporosis: A Report of the Surgeon General, an estimated 1 million people in the U.S. have Paget's disease, or about 1.3 people per 100 men and women age 45-74. The disease is more common in older people and those of Northern European heritage. Men are more likely than women to have the disease. Cause is Unknown Paget's disease is named after the British surgeon, Sir James Paget, who first identified the disease in 1877. Researchers are not sure what causes it. Heredity may be a factor in some cases. Research suggests that a close relative of someone with Paget's disease is seven times more likely to develop the disease than someone without an affected relative. However, most people with Paget's disease do not have any relatives with the disease. Researchers think the disease also may be caused by other factors, such as a slow-acting virus. A Treatable Disease The good news is that Paget's disease of bone is treatable, especially if it is diagnosed early. In recent years, the Food and Drug Administration has approved several medications that can stop or slow the disease's progression. In some cases, surgery can help patients manage the symptoms and complications of the disease.;Paget's Disease of Bone is an uncommon chronic bone disorder that affects one or multiple bones. It is characterized by excessive bone breakdown and formation, leading to abnormal bone remodeling. This results in bones that are enlarged, brittle, and weakened. The cause of Paget's disease is unknown, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treatment options may include medications to slow down bone breakdown and formation, pain relievers, and physical therapy.;0.002;363.0;74.0;0.237;0.046;0.144;0.807;-0.029;-0.203;0.154
282;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) polycystic kidney disease ?;Polycystic kidney disease is a disorder that affects the kidneys and other organs. Clusters of fluid-filled sacs, called cysts, develop in the kidneys and interfere with their ability to filter waste products from the blood. The growth of cysts causes the kidneys to become enlarged and can lead to kidney failure. Cysts may also develop in other organs, particularly the liver.  Frequent complications of polycystic kidney disease include dangerously high blood pressure (hypertension), pain in the back or sides, blood in the urine (hematuria), recurrent urinary tract infections, kidney stones, and heart valve abnormalities. Additionally, people with polycystic kidney disease have an increased risk of an abnormal bulging (an aneurysm) in a large blood vessel called the aorta or in blood vessels at the base of the brain. Aneurysms can be life-threatening if they tear or rupture.  The two major forms of polycystic kidney disease are distinguished by the usual age of onset and the pattern in which it is passed through families. The autosomal dominant form (sometimes called ADPKD) has signs and symptoms that typically begin in adulthood, although cysts in the kidney are often present from birth or childhood. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease can be further divided into type 1 and type 2, depending on the genetic cause. The autosomal recessive form of polycystic kidney disease (sometimes called ARPKD) is much rarer and is often lethal early in life. The signs and symptoms of this condition are usually apparent at birth or in early infancy.;Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of multiple cysts in the kidneys. These cysts are filled with fluid and can enlarge over time, causing the kidneys to become enlarged and unable to function properly. PKD can lead to high blood pressure, kidney failure, and other complications. There are two main types of PKD: autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD) and autosomal recessive PKD (ARPKD). ADPKD is the more common type and is caused by mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 genes. ARPKD is caused by mutations in the PKHD1 gene.;0.026;224.0;87.0;0.349;0.141;0.256;0.828;0.101;-0.026;0.231
283;gemini-pro;considerations;What to do for Urinary Incontinence in Men ?;- Urinary incontinence (UI) is the loss of bladder control, resulting in the accidental leakage of urine from the body.  - The urinary tract is the bodys drainage system for removing urine, which is composed of wastes and extra fluid.  - Every day, the kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine.  - To urinate, the brain signals the muscular bladder wall to tighten, squeezing urine out of the bladder. At the same time, the brain signals the sphincters to relax. As the sphincters relax, urine exits the bladder through the urethra.  - UI results when the brain does not properly signal the bladder, the sphincters do not squeeze strongly enough, or both.  - Urgency incontinence happens when a man urinates involuntarily after he has a strong desire, or urgency, to urinate.  - Stress incontinence results from movements that put pressure on the bladder and cause urine leakage, such as coughing, sneezing, laughing, or physical activity.  - Functional incontinence occurs when physical disability, external obstacles, or problems in thinking or communicating keep a person from reaching a place to urinate in time.  - When the bladder doesnt empty properly, urine spills over, causing overflow incontinence. Weak bladder muscles or a blocked urethra can cause this type of incontinence.  - Transient incontinence is UI that lasts a short time. Transient incontinence is usually a side effect of certain medications, drugs, or temporary conditions.  - UI occurs in 11 to 34 percent of older men.  - Men should tell a health care professional, such as a family practice physician, a nurse, an internist, or a urologist, they have UI, even if they feel embarrassed.  - Treatment depends on the type of UI. Some types of treatment include behavioral and lifestyle changes, bladder training, pelvic floor exercises, and urgency suppression.  - People who smoke should stop. Quitting smoking at any age promotes bladder health and overall health.;"1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - Reduce caffeine and alcohol intake.
   - Lose weight if overweight or obese.
   - Engage in regular pelvic floor muscle exercises (Kegels).
   - Manage underlying medical conditions.


2. **Behavioral Techniques:**
   - Double voiding (urinating twice in a row).
   - Scheduled voiding (urinating at regular intervals).
   - Bladder training (gradually increasing the time between urinations).


3. **Medications:**
   - Anticholinergics (e.g., oxybutynin, tolterodine) to reduce bladder muscle spasms.
   - Alpha-adrenergic agonists (e.g., tamsulosin, alfuzosin) to relax the prostate and bladder neck.
   - Mirabegron to increase bladder capacity and reduce urgency.


4. **Medical Devices:**
   - Penile clamps or external catheters to prevent leakage.
   - Intermittent catheterization to empty the bladder.


5. **Surgical Procedures:**

Signs and symptoms of mitochondrial complex III deficiency usually begin in infancy but can appear later.  The severity of mitochondrial complex III deficiency varies widely among affected individuals. People who are mildly affected tend to have muscle weakness (myopathy) and extreme tiredness (fatigue), particularly during exercise (exercise intolerance). More severely affected individuals have problems with multiple body systems, such as liver disease that can lead to liver failure, kidney abnormalities (tubulopathy), and brain dysfunction (encephalopathy). Encephalopathy can cause delayed development of mental and motor skills (psychomotor delay), movement problems, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and difficulty with communication. Some affected individuals have a form of heart disease called cardiomyopathy, which can lead to heart failure. Most people with mitochondrial complex III deficiency have a buildup of a chemical called lactic acid in the body (lactic acidosis). Some affected individuals also have buildup of molecules called ketones (ketoacidosis) or high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia). Abnormally high levels of these chemicals in the body can be life-threatening.  Mitochondrial complex III deficiency can be fatal in childhood, although individuals with mild signs and symptoms can survive into adolescence or adulthood.;"Mitochondrial complex III deficiency, also known as ubiquinone-cytochrome c reductase deficiency, is a rare genetic disorder that affects the electron transport chain in mitochondria, impairing the ability of cells to produce energy (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation.

286;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Cold Sores ?;Cold sores are caused by a contagious virus called herpes simplex virus (HSV). There are two types of HSV. Type 1 usually causes oral herpes, or cold sores. Type 1 herpes virus infects more than half of the U.S. population by the time they reach their 20s. Type 2 usually affects the genital area     Some people have no symptoms from the infection. But others develop painful and unsightly cold sores. Cold sores usually occur outside the mouth, on or around the lips. When they are inside the mouth, they are usually on the gums or the roof of the mouth. They are not the same as canker sores, which are not contagious.    There is no cure for cold sores. They normally go away on their own in a few weeks. Antiviral medicines can help them heal faster. They can also help to prevent cold sores in people who often get them. Other medicines can help with the pain and discomfort of the sores. These include ointments that numb the blisters, soften the crusts of the sores, or dry them out. Protecting your lips from the sun with sunblock lip balm can also help.;Cold sores, also known as fever blisters, are small, fluid-filled blisters that commonly appear on the lips, around the mouth, or on the nose. They are caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), and are highly contagious. Cold sores typically begin as small, red bumps that develop into blisters, eventually rupturing and forming a crust. The sores can be painful, itchy, and can take up to two weeks to heal completely. While cold sores are not typically serious, they can be uncomfortable and embarrassing. There is no cure for cold sores, but antiviral medications can help to reduce the severity and duration of outbreaks.;0.07;174.0;97.0;0.432;0.136;0.25;0.833;0.153;0.093;0.213

Individuals with MEN 2A are at high risk of developing medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. About 50% will develop pheochromocytoma, a tumor of the adrenal glands which may increase blood pressure. Individuals with MEN 2A are also at increased risk for parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia (overgrowth of the parathyroid gland). Occasionally an itchy skin condition called cutaneous lichen amyloidosis also occurs in people with type 2A disease. The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.;Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A) is a rare, inherited disorder characterized by the development of tumors in various endocrine glands. It typically involves the thyroid gland, parathyroid glands, and adrenal glands. In MEN2A, individuals are predisposed to developing medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), a type of thyroid cancer that originates in the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland. Additionally, they may develop parathyroid hyperplasia or tumors, leading to hyperparathyroidism, and pheochromocytoma, a tumor of the adrenal glands that can cause high blood pressure and other symptoms. MEN2A is caused by mutations in the RET proto-oncogene, which plays a role in regulating cell growth and differentiation. Genetic testing can be used to confirm the diagnosis and identify at-risk individuals within families. Screening and regular follow-up are crucial for early detection and management of tumors associated with MEN2A.;0.114;86.0;125.0;0.473;0.163;0.338;0.829;0.292;0.345;0.238
288;gemini-pro;exams and tests;How to diagnose Multiple myeloma ?;How is multiple myeloma diagnosed? A diagnosis of multiple myeloma may be suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. Additional testing can then be ordered to confirm the diagnosis. This may include: Specialized blood tests including immunoglobulin studies, complete blood count with differential, and blood chemistry studies Urine tests such as immunoglobulin studies and a twenty-four-hour urine test Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy Imaging studies such as an X-ray of the bones (skeletal bone survey), MRI, CT scan, and/or PET scan The American Cancer Society offers more information regarding the diagnosis of multiple myeloma, including a summary of the many tests that may be recommended. Please click on the link to access this resource. Some affected people may have no suspicious signs or symptoms of multiple myeloma, especially in the early stages of the condition. In these cases, multiple myeloma is sometimes diagnosed by chance when a blood test or urine test is ordered to investigate another condition.;Multiple myeloma is diagnosed through a combination of tests, including blood tests, urine tests, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, and imaging studies. Blood tests may reveal high levels of monoclonal proteins, such as immunoglobulin light chains or whole immunoglobulins, as well as elevated levels of calcium, creatinine, and beta-2 microglobulin. Urine tests can detect Bence Jones proteins, which are fragments of monoclonal immunoglobulins. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy can reveal the presence of abnormal plasma cells, which are the hallmark of multiple myeloma. Imaging studies, such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans, can detect bone lesions, lytic lesions, and other complications of multiple myeloma. Additional tests may include genetic studies to identify specific genetic abnormalities associated with the disease and cytogenetic analysis to assess the chromosomal abnormalities in the myeloma cells.;0.089;147.0;126.0;0.364;0.132;0.267;0.823;0.093;0.103;0.08
289;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to leptin receptor deficiency ?;Leptin receptor deficiency is caused by mutations in the LEPR gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called the leptin receptor, which is involved in the regulation of body weight. The leptin receptor protein is found on the surface of cells in many organs and tissues of the body including a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus controls hunger and thirst as well as other functions such as sleep, moods, and body temperature. It also regulates the release of many hormones that have functions throughout the body.  The leptin receptor is turned on (activated) by a hormone called leptin that attaches (binds) to the receptor, fitting into it like a key into a lock. Normally, the body's fat cells release leptin in proportion to their size. As fat cells become larger, they produce more leptin. This rise in leptin indicates that fat stores are increasing. In the hypothalamus, the binding of leptin to its receptor triggers a series of chemical signals that affect hunger and help produce a feeling of fullness (satiety).  LEPR gene mutations that cause leptin receptor deficiency prevent the receptor from responding to leptin, leading to the excessive hunger and weight gain associated with this disorder. Because hypogonadotropic hypogonadism occurs in leptin receptor deficiency, researchers suggest that leptin receptor signaling is also involved in regulating the body's response to hormones that control sexual development, and that this response is affected by LEPR gene mutations. However, the mechanism of this effect is unknown.  Leptin receptor deficiency is a rare cause of obesity. Researchers are studying the factors involved in more common forms of obesity.;Leptin receptor deficiency is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the LEPR gene, which encodes the leptin receptor. This receptor is responsible for binding leptin, a hormone produced by fat cells that signals the brain to suppress appetite and increase energy expenditure. Mutations in the LEPR gene can result in a non-functional leptin receptor, leading to leptin resistance and an inability to respond to the hormone's signals. As a result, individuals with leptin receptor deficiency experience excessive hunger, obesity, and an increased risk of developing metabolic complications such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.;0.029;242.0;86.0;0.357;0.108;0.227;0.878;0.118;-0.025;0.267

The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Autosomal recessive optic atrophy, hearing loss, and peripheral neuropathy. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Areflexia - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Broad-based gait - Distal muscle weakness - Distal sensory impairment - Distal upper limb amyotrophy - Gait ataxia - Joint contracture of the hand - Optic atrophy - Pectus excavatum - Peripheral demyelination - Positive Romberg sign - Progressive sensorineural hearing impairment - Short thumb - Thoracic scoliosis - Ulnar deviation of the hand - Variable expressivity - Visual impairment - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.;Autosomal recessive optic atrophy, hearing loss, and peripheral neuropathy is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a combination of vision problems, hearing impairment, and nerve damage in the extremities. Symptoms typically begin in childhood and can include progressive loss of central vision, difficulty distinguishing colors, night blindness, hearing loss, muscle weakness, difficulty walking, and impaired coordination. Speech problems and intellectual disability may also be present in some cases. The severity of symptoms can vary significantly between affected individuals.;0.014;256.0;74.0;0.231;0.082;0.171;0.714;-0.16;-0.333;0.022
291;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Ohdo syndrome, Say-Barber-Biesecker-Young-Simpson variant ?;The Say-Barber-Biesecker-Young-Simpson (SBBYS) variant of Ohdo syndrome is a rare condition characterized by genital abnormalities in males, missing or underdeveloped kneecaps (patellae), intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, and abnormalities affecting other parts of the body.  Males with the SBBYS variant of Ohdo syndrome typically have undescended testes (cryptorchidism). Females with this condition have normal genitalia.  Missing or underdeveloped patellae is the most common skeletal abnormality associated with the SBBYS variant of Ohdo syndrome. Affected individuals also have joint stiffness involving the hips, knees, and ankles that can impair movement. Although joints in the lower body are stiff, joints in the arms and upper body may be unusually loose (lax). Many people with this condition have long thumbs and first (big) toes.  The SBBYS variant of Ohdo syndrome is also associated with delayed development and intellectual disability, which are often severe. Many affected infants have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) that leads to breathing and feeding difficulties.  The SBBYS variant of Ohdo syndrome is characterized by a mask-like, non-expressive face. Additionally, affected individuals may have distinctive facial features such as prominent cheeks, a broad nasal bridge or a nose with a rounded tip, a narrowing of the eye opening (blepharophimosis), droopy eyelids (ptosis), and abnormalities of the tear (lacrimal) glands. About one-third of affected individuals are born with an opening in the roof of the mouth called a cleft palate. The SBBYS variant of Ohdo syndrome can also be associated with heart defects and dental problems.;Ohdo syndrome, Say-Barber-Biesecker-Young-Simpson variant is a rare genetic disorder characterized by distinctive facial features, intellectual disability, growth issues, and various medical complications. Key features include a broad forehead, wide-spaced eyes with droopy eyelids, a short nose with a broad nasal bridge, and a small mouth with thin lips. Individuals often have delayed development, intellectual disability, and speech difficulties. Growth problems, such as short stature and delayed bone age, are common. Additional features may include heart defects, kidney abnormalities, gastrointestinal issues, and an increased risk of infections. The disorder is caused by mutations in the ANKRD11 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that only one copy of the altered gene is sufficient to cause the condition. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings, genetic testing, and imaging studies.

292;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is Rheumatic Fever inherited ?;Is rheumatic fever inherited? Rheumatic fever is likely inherited in a multifactorial manner, which means it is caused by multiple genes interacting with each other and with environmental factors. The condition is thought to occur in genetically susceptible children who are infected with group A Streptococcus bacteria and live in poor social conditions. Some studies suggest that differences in the expression of various genes involved in the immune response may contribute to rheumatic fever susceptibility.;Rheumatic fever is not directly inherited, meaning there is no single gene that causes it. However, there is a genetic predisposition to developing rheumatic fever, which means certain genes can make a person more susceptible to the condition. This genetic susceptibility is thought to be related to the immune system's response to the bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes, which causes strep throat and scarlet fever. Individuals with certain genetic variations are more likely to mount an exaggerated immune response to the bacteria, leading to inflammation and damage to the heart, joints, and other organs. While genetics plays a role, environmental factors, such as exposure to strep bacteria and poverty, also contribute to the development of rheumatic fever.;0.043;70.0;105.0;0.432;0.108;0.24;0.92;0.212;0.236;0.185

294;gemini-pro;frequency;How many people are affected by 22q11.2 duplication ?;The prevalence of the 22q11.2 duplication in the general population is difficult to determine. Because many individuals with this duplication have no associated symptoms, their duplication may never be detected.  Most people tested for the 22q11.2 duplication have come to medical attention as a result of developmental delay or other problems affecting themselves or a family member. In one study, about 1 in 700 people tested for these reasons had the 22q11.2 duplication. Overall, more than 60 individuals with the duplication have been identified.;22q11.2 duplication syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects approximately 1 in 4,000 people worldwide. This means that an estimated 2.5 million individuals globally are living with the condition. The syndrome is characterized by a duplication of genetic material on the long arm of chromosome 22, specifically in the q11.2 region. This duplication can lead to a range of physical, developmental, and cognitive features, including heart defects, immune system dysfunction, intellectual disability, and psychiatric disorders. The prevalence of 22q11.2 duplication syndrome varies slightly among different populations, with a slightly higher prevalence reported in individuals of European descent.;0.047;76.0;88.0;0.21;0.066;0.129;0.869;0.022;0.065;-0.023
295;gemini-pro;outlook;What is the outlook for Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ?;Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on:         - How quickly and how low the leukemia cell count drops after the first month of treatment.    - Age at the time of diagnosis, gender, race, and ethnic background.    - The number of white blood cells in the blood at the time of diagnosis.    - Whether the leukemia cells began from B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes.    - Whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes or genes of the lymphocytes with cancer.    - Whether the child has Down syndrome.    - Whether leukemia cells are found in the cerebrospinal fluid.    - The child's weight at the time of diagnosis and during treatment.        Treatment options depend on:         - Whether the leukemia cells began from B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes.    - Whether the child has standard-risk, high-risk, or very highrisk ALL.    - The age of the child at the time of diagnosis.    - Whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes of lymphocytes, such as the Philadelphia chromosome.    - Whether the child was treated with steroids before the start of induction therapy.    - How quickly and how low the leukemia cell count drops during treatment.        For leukemia that relapses (comes back) after treatment, the prognosis and treatment options depend partly on the following:         - How long it is between the time of diagnosis and when the leukemia comes back.    - Whether the leukemia comes back in the bone marrow or in other parts of the body.;The outlook for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has improved dramatically over the past few decades. With modern treatment protocols, the overall survival rate for children with ALL is now approximately 90%. However, the outlook can vary depending on the child's age, the specific genetic features of the leukemia, and how well the leukemia responds to treatment. Children who are younger than 1 year old or older than 10 years old at diagnosis tend to have a lower survival rate. Additionally, children with certain genetic abnormalities, such as the Philadelphia chromosome, also have a lower survival rate. Despite these challenges, ongoing research and the development of new treatments continue to improve the outlook for children with ALL.;0.015;203.0;105.0;0.263;0.033;0.168;0.646;-0.112;-0.169;-0.057
296;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) leptin receptor deficiency ?;Leptin receptor deficiency is a condition that causes severe obesity beginning in the first few months of life. Affected individuals are of normal weight at birth, but they are constantly hungry and quickly gain weight. The extreme hunger leads to chronic excessive eating (hyperphagia) and obesity. Beginning in early childhood, affected individuals develop abnormal eating behaviors such as fighting with other children over food, hoarding food, and eating in secret.  People with leptin receptor deficiency also have hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which is a condition caused by reduced production of hormones that direct sexual development. Affected individuals experience delayed puberty or do not go through puberty, and may be unable to conceive children (infertile).;Leptin receptor deficiency is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the leptin receptor gene (LEPR). This receptor is responsible for transmitting signals from the hormone leptin, which plays a crucial role in regulating appetite, body weight, and energy expenditure. In individuals with leptin receptor deficiency, the body is unable to respond to leptin, leading to an insatiable appetite, excessive food intake, and severe obesity. This condition can manifest early in life and is often accompanied by additional complications such as metabolic abnormalities, reproductive dysfunction, and an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases.;0.066;108.0;86.0;0.336;0.088;0.154;0.889;0.134;0.095;0.17
297;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Snoring ?;Snoring is the sound you make when your breathing is blocked while you are asleep. The sound is caused by tissues at the top of your airway that strike each other and vibrate. Snoring is common, especially among older people and people who are overweight.    When severe, snoring can cause frequent awakenings at night and daytime sleepiness. It can disrupt your bed partner's sleep. Snoring can also be a sign of a serious sleep disorder called sleep apnea. You should see your health care provider if you are often tired during the day, don't feel that you sleep well, or wake up gasping.    To reduce snoring       - Lose weight if you are overweight. It may help, but thin people can snore, too.    - Cut down or avoid alcohol and other sedatives at bedtime    - Don't sleep flat on your back       NIH: National Institute on Aging;Snoring is a common sleep disorder characterized by noisy breathing during sleep. It occurs when the airflow through the throat is obstructed, causing the tissues to vibrate and produce a snoring sound. Snoring can be caused by various factors, including nasal congestion, enlarged tonsils or adenoids, a deviated septum, or obesity. It can also be a sign of more serious conditions such as sleep apnea, in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. While snoring is often considered a nuisance, it can also negatively impact睡眠質量and increase the risk of cardiovascular problems and other health issues.;0.054;136.0;87.0;0.354;0.114;0.215;0.837;0.094;0.074;0.112
298;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Rh deficiency syndrome ?;The Rh deficiency syndrome, also known as Rh-null syndrome, is a blood disorder where people have red blood cells (RBCs) lacking all Rh antigens. The Rh antigens maintain the integrity of the RBC membrane and therefore, RBCs which lack Rh antigens have an abnormal shape. There are two types of Rh deficiency syndrome: The regulator type is associated with many different changes (mutations) in the RHAG gene .  The amorph type is caused by inactive copies of a gene (silent alleles) at the RH locus. As a result, the RBCs do not express any of the Rh antigens. The absence of the Rh complex alters the RBC shape, increases its tendency to break down (osmotic fragility), and shortens its lifespan, resulting in a hemolytic anemia that is usually mild. These patients are at risk of having adverse transfusion reactions because they may produce antibodies against several of the Rh antigens and can only receive blood from people who have the same condition. Rh deficiency syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Management is individualized according to the severity of hemolytic anemia.;Rh deficiency syndrome, also known as erythroblastosis fetalis, is a condition in which a fetus or newborn baby has an Rh-positive red blood cell antigen, while the mother has Rh-negative red blood cells. This can lead to the production of antibodies in the mother's body that attack the baby's red blood cells, causing hemolytic anemia, a condition in which red blood cells are destroyed prematurely. Rh deficiency syndrome can cause a range of symptoms in affected babies, including jaundice, anemia, swelling of the spleen and liver, and neurological problems. Treatment for Rh deficiency syndrome may involve blood transfusions, phototherapy to reduce bilirubin levels, and medications to suppress the mother's immune response. Prevention of Rh deficiency syndrome can be achieved through the administration of Rh immunoglobulin (RhoGAM) to Rh-negative mothers during pregnancy and after delivery.;0.073;159.0;122.0;0.245;0.072;0.181;0.74;0.011;-0.029;0.048

If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal recessive inheritance - Jejunal atresia - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.;Jejunal atresia, a rare congenital anomaly, impedes the passage of intestinal contents through the small intestine, causing a range of symptoms in newborns. The most common and immediate indication is bilious vomiting, a greenish-yellow discharge from the mouth due to the obstruction of bile flow. Additional symptoms may include abdominal distension, failure to pass meconium (the first stool) within 24-48 hours after birth, and constipation. Newborns with jejunal atresia may also experience dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and malnutrition due to the inability to absorb nutrients properly. Early diagnosis and surgical intervention are crucial to prevent life-threatening complications.;0.005;236.0;86.0;0.225;0.035;0.137;0.709;-0.099;-0.211;0.015
312;gemini-pro;treatment;What are the treatments for Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome ?;How might Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome be treated? Medications and therapies used to treat Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome may include anticholinesterase agents (e.g., Pyridostigmine), guanidine hydrochloride, plasmapheresis (where blood plasma is removed and replaced with fluid, protein, or donated plasma) or IV immunoglobulins, steroids (e.g., prednisone), azathioprine or cyclosporine, and/or 3,4-diaminopyridine. 3,4-diaminopyridine is available in Europe and may be available in the U.S. on a compassionate use basis. While there has been some evidence that either 3,4-diaminopyridine or IV immunoglobulin can improve muscle strength and nerve to muscle cell communication, the degree of benefit (i.e., how much symptoms are improved) still needs to be determined.;Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune disorder that affects the communication between nerves and muscles. In LEMS, the immune system mistakenly attacks the presynaptic nerve terminals, which are the points where nerve cells release acetylcholine, a chemical messenger that helps muscles contract. The most common treatment for LEMS is a medication called pyridostigmine bromide, which helps to improve muscle strength and function. Other treatments may include immunosuppressive medications, such as corticosteroids, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil, which are used to suppress the immune system and prevent it from attacking the nerve terminals. In some cases, plasmapheresis, a procedure that filters and removes harmful substances from the blood, may be used to reduce the severity of symptoms. Additionally, supportive care, such as physical therapy and respiratory support, may be necessary to manage the symptoms of LEMS.;0.047;100.0;121.0;0.341;0.087;0.183;0.77;-0.001;-0.034;0.028
313;gemini-pro;treatment;What are the treatments for Narcolepsy ?;"Narcolepsy has no cure. However, medicines, lifestyle changes, and other therapies can relieve many of its symptoms. Treatment for narcolepsy is based on the type of symptoms you have and how severe they are.
                
Not all medicines and lifestyle changes work for everyone. It may take weeks to months for you and your doctor to find the best treatment.
                
Medicines
                
You may need one or more medicines to treat narcolepsy symptoms. These may include:
                
Stimulants to ease daytime sleepiness and raise your alertness.
                
A medicine that helps make up for the low levels of hypocretin in your brain. (Hypocretin is a chemical that helps promote wakefulness.) This medicine helps you stay awake during the day and sleep at night. It doesn't always completely relieve daytime sleepiness, so your doctor may tell you to take it with a stimulant.
                
Medicines that help you sleep at night.
                
Medicines used to treat depression. These medicines also help prevent cataplexy, hallucinations, and sleep paralysis.
                
Some prescription and over-the-counter medicines can interfere with your sleep. Ask your doctor about these medicines and how to avoid them, if possible. For example, your doctor may advise you to avoid antihistamines. These medicines suppress the action of histamine, a substance in the blood that promotes wakefulness.
                
If you take regular naps when you feel sleepy, you may need less medicine to stay awake.
                
Lifestyle Changes
                
Lifestyle changes also may help relieve some narcolepsy symptoms. You can take steps to make it easier to fall asleep at night and stay asleep.
                
Follow a regular sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day.
                
Do something relaxing before bedtime, such as taking a warm bath.
                
Keep your bedroom or sleep area quiet, comfortable, dark, and free from distractions, such as a TV or computer.
                
Allow yourself about 20 minutes to fall asleep or fall back asleep after waking up. After that, get up and do something relaxing (like reading) until you get sleepy.
                
Certain activities, foods, and drinks before bedtime can keep you awake. Try to follow these guidelines:
                
Exercise regularly, but not within 3 hours of bedtime.
                
Avoid tobacco, alcohol, chocolate, and drinks that contain caffeine for several hours before bedtime.
                
Avoid large meals and beverages just before bedtime.
                
Avoid bright lights before bedtime.

Other Therapies
                
Light therapy may help you keep a regular sleep and wake schedule. For this type of therapy, you sit in front of a light box, which has special lights, for 10 to 30 minutes. This therapy can help you feel less sleepy in the morning.";Narcolepsy, a chronic neurological disorder that disrupts the brain's ability to control sleep-wake cycles, can be managed with a combination of lifestyle adjustments, medications, and behavioral therapies. Lifestyle modifications include maintaining a regular sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and engaging in regular exercise. Medications commonly used to treat narcolepsy include stimulants like modafinil and armodafinil to promote wakefulness, and sodium oxybate or Xyrem to improve nighttime sleep and reduce daytime sleepiness. Behavioral therapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can help individuals with narcolepsy develop coping mechanisms and strategies to manage their symptoms. Additionally, certain medications like antidepressants or antihistamines may be prescribed to address specific symptoms like cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness.;0.003;429.0;109.0;0.248;0.045;0.121;0.788;-0.061;-0.175;0.055

Insulin resistance is a condition in which the body produces insulin but does not use it properly. This causes the pancreas to produce more insulin. High levels of insulin stimulate the ovaries to make too much androgen, leading too excessive  hair growth, acne, and irregular periods. Insulin resistance can also lead to diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and excessive growth and darkening of the skin (aconthosis nigricans). Women with HAIR-AN may be born with insulin resistance or acquire it over time.;HAIR-AN syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and acanthosis nigricans. It is caused by mutations in the INSR gene, which encodes the insulin receptor. Symptoms typically appear in adolescence and include excessive hair growth (hirsutism), acne, irregular periods, and weight gain. Insulin resistance can lead to type 2 diabetes, and acanthosis nigricans is a skin condition characterized by dark, velvety patches of skin.

Individuals with neurosyphilis can be treated with penicillin given by vein, or by daily intramuscular injections for 10  14 days. If they are treated with daily penicillin injections, individuals must also take probenecid by mouth four times a day. Some medical professionals recommend another antibiotic called ceftriaxone for neurosyphilis treatment. This drug is usually given daily by vein, but it can also be given by intramuscular injection. Individuals who receive ceftriaxone are also treated for 10 - 14 days. People with HIV/AIDS who get treated for neurosyphilis may have different outcomes than individuals without HIV/AIDS.;Neurosyphilis, a late-stage complication of untreated syphilis, can manifest in various forms affecting the brain, spinal cord, and eyes. Treatment options depend on the specific manifestations and stage of the disease. The mainstay of therapy is penicillin, a potent antibiotic effective in eliminating the causative organism, Treponema pallidum. In cases of penicillin allergy or intolerance, alternative antibiotics like doxycycline or ceftriaxone may be used. In neurosyphilis involving the central nervous system, high-dose intravenous penicillin is typically administered for an extended duration to ensure adequate penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid and eradication of the infection.

322;gemini-pro;information;Do you have information about Hip Replacement;Summary : Hip replacement is surgery for people with severe hip damage. The most common cause of damage is osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis causes pain, swelling, and reduced motion in your joints. It can interfere with your daily activities. If other treatments such as physical therapy, pain medicines, and exercise haven't helped, hip replacement surgery might be an option for you.    During a hip replacement operation, the surgeon removes damaged cartilage and bone from your hip joint and replaces them with new, man-made parts.    A hip replacement can       - Relieve pain    - Help your hip joint work better    - Improve walking and other movements       The most common problem after surgery is hip dislocation. Because a man-made hip is smaller than the original joint, the ball can come out of its socket. The surgery can also cause blood clots and infections. With a hip replacement, you might need to avoid certain activities, such as jogging and high-impact sports.    NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases;"Yes, I have information about replacement.

Replacement is the act of replacing something with another thing. In a medical context, replacement can refer to a number of procedures, including:

* Joint replacement: This is a surgical procedure in which a damaged or worn joint is replaced with an artificial one. This can be done for a number of joints, including the hip, knee, and shoulder.
* Organ transplantation: This is a surgical procedure in which a damaged or diseased organ is replaced with a healthy one from a donor. This can be done for a number of organs, including the heart, liver, kidneys, and lungs.
* Tissue engineering: This is a field of research that focuses on the development of new tissues and organs that can be used to replace damaged or diseased ones. This field is still in its early stages, but shows promise for the future.

This condition is characterized by severe hypertension that begins unusually early in life, often in childhood, although some affected individuals are not diagnosed until adulthood. Some people with Liddle syndrome have no additional signs or symptoms, especially in childhood. Over time, however, untreated hypertension can lead to heart disease or stroke, which may be fatal.  In addition to hypertension, affected individuals can have low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia). Signs and symptoms of hypokalemia include muscle weakness or pain, fatigue, constipation, or heart palpitations. The shortage of potassium can also raise the pH of the blood, a condition known as metabolic alkalosis.;Liddle syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by high blood pressure, low potassium levels, and metabolic alkalosis (an abnormally high blood pH). It is caused by a mutation in the SCNN1B or SCNN1G gene, which makes the body unable to properly reabsorb sodium and potassium in the kidneys. This leads to increased sodium and decreased potassium levels in the blood, resulting in high blood pressure and metabolic alkalosis. Liddle syndrome is usually diagnosed through blood and urine tests, and treatment typically involves diuretics (medications that increase urine output) and potassium supplements.;0.037;109.0;85.0;0.336;0.09;0.229;0.891;0.063;0.006;0.118

Mutations in these genes can disrupt the normal function of potassium channels, leading to a variety of symptoms, including heart rhythm problems, muscle weakness, and periodic paralysis.;0.029;58.0;87.0;0.248;0.06;0.133;0.808;0.064;0.103;0.022
326;gemini-pro;treatment;What are the treatments for High Blood Cholesterol ?;"High blood cholesterol is treated with lifestyle changes and medicines. The main goal of treatment is to lower your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level enough to reduce your risk for coronary heart disease, heart attack, and other related health problems.
                
Your risk for heart disease and heart attack goes up as your LDL cholesterol level rises and your number of heart disease risk factors increases.
                
Some people are at high risk for heart attacks because they already have heart disease. Other people are at high risk for heart disease because they have diabetes or more than one heart disease risk factor.
                
Talk with your doctor about lowering your cholesterol and your risk for heart disease. Also, check the list to find out whether you have risk factors that affect your LDL cholesterol goal:
                
Cigarette smoking
                
High blood pressure (140/90 mmHg or higher), or youre on medicine to treat high blood pressure
                
Low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (less than 40 mg/dL)
                
Family history of early heart disease (heart disease in father or brother before age 55; heart disease in mother or sister before age 65)
                
Age (men 45 years or older; women 55 years or older)
                
You can use the NHLBI 10-Year Risk Calculator to find your risk score. The score, given as a percentage, refers to your chance of having a heart attack in the next 10years.
                
Based on your medical history, number of risk factors, and risk score, figure out your risk of getting heart disease or having a heart attack using the table below.
                
* Some people in this category are at very high risk because theyve just had a heart attack or they have diabetes and heart disease, severe risk factors, or metabolic syndrome. If youre at very high risk, your doctor may set your LDL goal even lower, to less than 70 mg/dL. Your doctor also may set your LDL goal at this lower level if you have heart disease alone.
                
After following the above steps, you should have an idea about your risk for heart disease and heart attack. The two main ways to lower your cholesterol (and, thus, your heart disease risk) include:
                
Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC). TLC is a three-part program that includes a healthy diet, weight management, and physical activity. TLC is for anyone whose LDL cholesterol level is above goal.
                
Medicines. If cholesterol-lowering medicines are needed, theyre used with the TLC program to help lower your LDL cholesterol level.
                
Your doctor will set your LDL goal. The higher your risk for heart disease, the lower he or she will set your LDL goal. Using the following guide, you and your doctor can create a plan for treating your high blood cholesterol.
                
Category I, high risk, your LDL goal is less than 100 mg/dL.*
                
* Your LDL goal may be set even lower, to less than 70 mg/dL, if youre at very high risk or if you have heart disease. If you have this lower goal and your LDL is 70 mg/dL or higher, youll need to begin the TLC diet and take medicines as prescribed.
                
Category II, moderately high risk, your LDL goal is less than 130 mg/dL
                
Category III, moderate risk, your LDL goal is less than 130 mg/dL.
                
Category IV, low to moderate risk, your LDL goal is less than 160 mg/dL.
                

                
Lowering Cholesterol Using Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes
                

                
TLC is a set of lifestyle changes that can help you lower your LDL cholesterol. The main parts of the TLC program are a healthy diet, weight management, and physical activity.
                
The TLC Diet
                
With the TLC diet, less than 7 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. This kind of fat is found in some meats, dairy products, chocolate, baked goods, and deep-fried and processed foods.
                
No more than 25 to 35 percent of your daily calories should come from all fats, including saturated, trans, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats.
                
You also should have less than 200 mg a day of cholesterol. The amounts of cholesterol and the types of fat in prepared foods can be found on the foods' Nutrition Facts labels.
                
Foods high in soluble fiber also are part of the TLC diet. They help prevent the digestive tract from absorbing cholesterol. These foods include:
                
Whole-grain cereals such as oatmeal and oat bran
                
Fruits such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes
                
Legumes such as kidney beans, lentils, chick peas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans
                
A diet rich in fruits and vegetables can increase important cholesterol-lowering compounds in your diet. These compounds, called plant stanols or sterols, work like soluble fiber.
                
A healthy diet also includes some types of fish, such as salmon, tuna (canned or fresh), and mackerel. These fish are a good source of omega-3 fatty acids. These acids may help protect the heart from blood clots and inflammation and reduce the risk of heart attack. Try to have about two fish meals every week.
                
You also should try to limit the amount of sodium (salt) that you eat. This means choosing low-salt and ""no added salt"" foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. The Nutrition Facts label on food packaging shows the amount of sodium in the item.
                
Try to limit drinks with alcohol. Too much alcohol will raise your blood pressure and triglyceride level. (Triglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood.) Alcohol also adds extra calories, which will cause weight gain.
                
Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is a glass of wine, beer, or a small amount of hard liquor.

Weight Management
                
If youre overweight or obese, losing weight can help lower LDL cholesterol. Maintaining a healthy weight is especially important if you have a condition called metabolic syndrome.
                
Metabolic syndrome is the name for a group of risk factors that raise your risk for heart disease and other health problems, such as diabetes and stroke.
                
The five metabolic risk factors are a large waistline (abdominal obesity), a high triglyceride level, a low HDL cholesterol level, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar. Metabolic syndrome is diagnosed if you have at least three of these metabolic risk factors.
                
Physical Activity
                
Routine physical activity can lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and raise your HDL cholesterol level.
                
People gain health benefits from as little as 60 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week. The more active you are, the more you will benefit.
                
For more information about physical activity, go to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' ""2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans,"" the Health Topics Physical Activity and Your Heart article, and the NHLBI's ""Your Guide to Physical Activity and Your Heart.""
                
Cholesterol-Lowering Medicines
                
In addition to lifestyle changes, your doctor may prescribe medicines to help lower your cholesterol. Even with medicines, you should continue the TLC program.
                
Medicines can help control high blood cholesterol, but they dont cure it. Thus, you must continue taking your medicine to keep your cholesterol level in the recommended range.
                
The five major types of cholesterol-lowering medicines are statins, bile acid sequestrants (seh-KWES-trants), nicotinic (nick-o-TIN-ick) acid, fibrates, and ezetimibe.
                
Statins work well at lowering LDL cholesterol. These medicines are safe for most people. Rare side effects include muscle and liver problems.
                
Bile acid sequestrants also help lower LDL cholesterol. These medicines usually arent prescribed as the only medicine to lower cholesterol. Sometimes theyre prescribed with statins.
                
Nicotinic acid lowers LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and raises HDL cholesterol. You should only use this type of medicine with a doctors supervision.
                
Fibrates lower triglycerides, and they may raise HDL cholesterol. When used with statins, fibrates may increase the risk of muscle problems.
                
Ezetimibe lowers LDL cholesterol. This medicine works by blocking the intestine from absorbing cholesterol.
                
While youre being treated for high blood cholesterol, youll need ongoing care. Your doctor will want to make sure your cholesterol levels are controlled. He or she also will want to check for other health problems.
                
If needed, your doctor may prescribe medicines for other health problems. Take all medicines exactly as your doctor prescribes. The combination of medicines may lower your risk for heart disease and heart attack.
                
While trying to manage your cholesterol, take steps to manage other heart disease risk factors too. For example, if you have high blood pressure, work with your doctor to lower it.
                
If you smoke, quit. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. If youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. Your doctor can help you create a reasonable weight-loss plan.";"High blood cholesterol is a condition in which there is too much cholesterol in the blood. It is a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke, and other health problems. Treatment for high blood cholesterol typically includes lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and losing weight; and medication, such as statins, bile acid resins, niacin, and PCSK9 inhibitors. Statins are the most commonly prescribed medication for high blood cholesterol. They work by reducing the production of cholesterol in the liver. Lifestyle changes and medication can help lower blood cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.";0.0;1396.0;96.0;0.196;0.054;0.123;0.718;-0.149;-0.313;0.024

330;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to spastic paraplegia type 8 ?;Mutations in the KIAA0196 gene cause spastic paraplegia type 8. The KIAA0196 gene provides instructions for making a protein called strumpellin. Strumpellin is active (expressed) throughout the body, although its exact function is unknown. The protein's structure suggests that strumpellin may interact with the structural framework inside cells (the cytoskeleton) and may attach (bind) to other proteins.  KIAA0196 gene mutations are thought to change the structure of the strumpellin protein. It is unknown how the altered strumpellin protein causes the signs and symptoms of spastic paraplegia type 8.;Spastic paraplegia type 8 (SPG8) is caused by mutations in the NIPA1 gene, which encodes a protein involved in neuronal survival and development. Mutations in this gene lead to a loss of function of the NIPA1 protein, resulting in the degeneration of motor neurons and the development of spasticity and weakness in the lower limbs. The genetic changes associated with SPG8 are predominantly missense mutations, which result in the substitution of a single amino acid in the NIPA1 protein. These mutations disrupt the normal structure and function of the protein, leading to the neurological symptoms characteristic of SPG8.;0.045;77.0;84.0;0.318;0.054;0.206;0.689;0.114;0.098;0.126
331;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to Imerslund-Grsbeck syndrome ?;Mutations in the AMN or CUBN gene can cause Imerslund-Grsbeck syndrome. The AMN gene provides instructions for making a protein called amnionless, and the CUBN gene provides instructions for making a protein called cubilin. Together, these proteins play a role in the uptake of vitamin B12 from food. Vitamin B12, which cannot be made in the body and can only be obtained from food, is essential for the formation of DNA and proteins, the production of cellular energy, and the breakdown of fats. This vitamin is involved in the formation of red blood cells and maintenance of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system).  The amnionless protein is embedded primarily in the membrane of kidney cells and cells that line the small intestine. Amnionless attaches (binds) to cubilin, anchoring cubilin to the cell membrane. Cubilin can interact with molecules and proteins passing through the intestine or kidneys. During digestion, vitamin B12 is released from food. As the vitamin passes through the small intestine, cubilin binds to it. Amnionless helps transfer the cubilin-vitamin B12 complex into the intestinal cell. From there, the vitamin is released into the blood and transported throughout the body. In the kidney, the amnionless and cubilin proteins are involved in the reabsorption of certain proteins that would otherwise be released in urine.  Mutations in the AMN gene prevent cubilin from attaching to the cells in the small intestine and kidneys. Without cubilin function in the small intestine, vitamin B12 is not taken into the body. A shortage of this essential vitamin impairs the proper development of red blood cells, leading to megaloblastic anemia. Low levels of vitamin B12 can also affect the central nervous system, causing neurological problems. In addition, without cubilin function in the kidneys, proteins are not reabsorbed and are instead released in urine, leading to proteinuria.  Like AMN gene mutations, some CUBN gene mutations impair cubilin's function in both the small intestine and the kidneys, leading to a shortage of vitamin B12 and proteinuria. Other CUBN gene mutations affect cubilin's function only in the small intestine, impairing uptake of vitamin B12 into the intestinal cells. Individuals with these mutations have a shortage of vitamin B12, which can lead to megaloblastic anemia and neurological problems, but not proteinuria.;Imerslund-Grsbeck syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by selective vitamin B12 malabsorption due to mutations in the CUBN gene, which encodes the cubilin protein. Cubilin is a receptor expressed in the proximal tubules of the kidney and the ileum that is involved in the uptake of vitamin B12 from the gastrointestinal tract and its reabsorption in the kidneys. Mutations in the CUBN gene lead to impaired vitamin B12 absorption, resulting in low levels of vitamin B12 in the body.;0.005;331.0;68.0;0.291;0.1;0.201;0.697;0.014;-0.121;0.155
332;gemini-pro;treatment;What are the treatments for Oral lichen planus ?;How might oral lichen planus be treated? It is important to identify and remove any potential agent that might have caused a lichenoid reaction. Chemicals or medications associated with development of lichen planus include gold, antibiotics, arsenic, iodides, chloroquine, quinacrine, quinidine, antimony, phenothiazines, diuretics such as chlorothiazide, and many others.[2483] Consideration regarding role of drugs that were started in recent months prior to the on set of oral lichen planus, as well as any contact allergens identified by patch testing is recommended. Symptoms may improve with the following measures: Meticulous oral hygiene Stopping smoking Topical steroids as drops, pastes, gels or sprays (e.g., triamcinolone paste) Steroid injections (intralesional triamcinolone) Mouth rinse containing the calcineurin inhibitors: cyclosporin or tacrolimus In severe cases systemic corticosteroids may be used. Other possible therapeutic agents may include: Thalidomide Systemic retinoids (acitretin or isotretinoin) Griseofulvin Azathioprine Cyclophosphamide Dapsone Metronidazole Low molecular weight heparin;Oral lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory condition that affects the oral mucosa. Treatment options aim to manage symptoms and prevent complications. First-line treatments include topical corticosteroids, such as clobetasol or fluocinonide, which can reduce inflammation and relieve pain. Other topical agents like tacrolimus or pimecrolimus may also be effective. In severe cases, systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs may be necessary. Additionally, lifestyle modifications, such as avoiding triggers like certain foods or stress, can help manage symptoms. In some cases, surgical intervention may be required to remove affected tissue or correct any scarring or deformity. Regular monitoring by a healthcare professional is essential to assess treatment response and prevent long-term complications.;0.048;143.0;108.0;0.277;0.066;0.195;0.736;-0.057;-0.174;0.063

Surgical resection (removal of the area of the brain with the tumor) has been the standard treatment reported in the medical literature. The size of the resection is probably based on the size of the tumor, although the extent of the resection is not documented for all cases reported in the medical literature. Adjuvant therapy is generally not performed when a gross total resection can be performed. When total resection is not possible, some of suggested chemotherapy, as the effects of radiation on extremely young children may be harmful.;Desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma (DIG) is a rare brain tumor that typically affects infants and young children. There is no standard treatment for DIG, and the best course of action will depend on the individual patient's situation. Treatment options may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these. Surgery is often the first line of treatment, and the goal is to remove as much of the tumor as possible. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be used to treat any remaining tumor cells or to prevent the tumor from coming back.;0.025;83.0;83.0;0.336;0.065;0.248;0.764;0.11;0.073;0.146

                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.";Clinical trials are actively investigating new treatment strategies for paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer, including targeted therapies, immunotherapy, and novel radiation techniques. Researchers are exploring the use of targeted drugs that block specific molecules involved in cancer growth and survival. Immunotherapy approaches aim to harness the body's immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. Additionally, clinical trials are evaluating the effectiveness of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and proton therapy in improving treatment outcomes while minimizing side effects. Ongoing research is also focused on identifying biomarkers that can predict treatment response and prognosis, enabling personalized treatment plans for patients with paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer.;0.011;234.0;104.0;0.211;0.034;0.126;0.363;-0.076;-0.065;-0.091

337;gemini-pro;treatment;What are the treatments for Fibrous dysplasia ?;How might fibrous dysplasia be treated? Unfortunately, there is no cure for fibrous dysplasia. Treatment depends on the symptoms that develop. Fractures often require surgery, but can sometimes be treated with casting or splints.] Surgery is most appropriate in cases where fractures are likely to occur, or where bones have become misshapen. Surgery may also be used to relieve pain. Medications known as bisphosphonates are also used to relieve bone pain. Other healthy strategies such as physical activity and adequate intake of calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D are also encouraged.[  Radiation therapy is not recommended for patients with fibrous dysplasia because it is associated with an increased risk of cancerous transformation. Careful, long-term follow-up to monitor fibrous dysplasia is advised.;Fibrous dysplasia, a bone disorder characterized by the abnormal growth of fibrous tissue within the bone, can be managed through various treatment approaches. Treatment options may include medications, such as bisphosphonates, to reduce bone pain and prevent further bone loss. Surgery is sometimes necessary to correct bone deformities, relieve pressure on nerves or blood vessels, or remove weakened bone segments. Physical therapy and rehabilitation can help improve muscle strength and range of motion, while bracing or casting can provide support and stability to affected areas. In severe cases, targeted radiation therapy may be used to control excessive bone growth. Additionally, medications like pamidronate or zoledronic acid can help reduce bone pain and prevent fractures. Ongoing monitoring and regular check-ups are essential to assess the effectiveness of treatment and make any necessary adjustments.;0.028;118.0;128.0;0.345;0.069;0.172;0.863;0.108;0.111;0.102
338;gemini-pro;exams and tests;How to diagnose Salivary Gland Cancer ?;Tests that examine the head, neck, and the inside of the mouth are used to detect (find) and diagnose salivary gland cancer. The following procedures may be used:         -  Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health. The head, neck, mouth, and throat will be checked for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.    -   Endoscopy : A procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for abnormal areas. For salivary gland cancer, an endoscope is inserted into the mouth to look at the mouth, throat, and larynx. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing.     -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer.               -  Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy : The removal of tissue or fluid using a thin needle. An FNA is the most common type of biopsy used for salivary gland cancer.      -  Incisional biopsy : The removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue that doesnt look normal.      -  Surgery : If cancer cannot be diagnosed from the sample of tissue removed during an FNA biopsy or an incisional biopsy, the mass may be removed and checked for signs of cancer.                 Because salivary gland cancer can be hard to diagnose, patients should ask to have the tissue samples checked by a pathologist who has experience in diagnosing salivary gland cancer.;Diagnosing salivary gland cancer involves a comprehensive approach. It typically starts with a thorough physical examination of the head and neck area, followed by imaging tests such as MRI or CT scans to assess the extent and location of the tumor. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy or core needle biopsy is often performed to extract cells from the suspicious mass for microscopic examination by a pathologist. Additional tests may include blood tests to evaluate tumor markers and rule out other conditions. In some cases, specialized imaging techniques like PET scans or salivary gland scintigraphy may be recommended to further evaluate the extent of the disease. A definitive diagnosis is usually confirmed through a surgical biopsy, where a portion of the tumor is removed and analyzed under a microscope.;0.005;381.0;112.0;0.291;0.047;0.153;0.746;-0.048;-0.151;0.057
339;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is galactosemia inherited ?;This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.;Yes, galactosemia is an inherited disorder caused by a genetic mutation that leads to the body's inability to properly metabolize the sugar galactose. This mutation is passed down from parents to children through their genes, and individuals who inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) will have galactosemia. The inheritance pattern of galactosemia is autosomal recessive, meaning that both copies of the gene must be mutated in order for the disorder to manifest.;0.067;44.0;69.0;0.391;0.13;0.207;0.569;0.197;0.302;0.094
340;gemini-pro;information;Do you have information about Breast Reconstruction;Summary : If you need a mastectomy, you have a choice about whether or not to have surgery to rebuild the shape of the breast. Instead of breast reconstruction, you could choose to wear a breast form that replaces the breast, wear padding inside your bra, or do nothing. All of these options have pros and cons. What is right for one woman may not be right for another.    Breast reconstruction may be done at the same time as the mastectomy, or it may be done later on. If radiation therapy is part of the treatment plan, your doctor may suggest waiting until after radiation therapy.    If you're thinking about breast reconstruction, talk to a plastic surgeon before the mastectomy, even if you plan to have your reconstruction later on.    A surgeon can reconstruct the breast in many ways. Some women choose to have breast implants, which are filled with saline or silicone gel. Another method uses tissue taken from another part of your body. The plastic surgeon can take skin, muscle, and fat from your lower abdomen, back, or buttocks.    The type of reconstruction that is best for you depends on your age, body type, and the type of cancer surgery that you had. A plastic surgeon can help you decide.    NIH: National Cancer Institute;Breast reconstruction is a surgical procedure that aims to restore the shape and appearance of the breast after mastectomy, a surgery to remove breast tissue, typically performed due to breast cancer. The goal of breast reconstruction is to create a breast mound that resembles the natural breast in size, shape, and symmetry. There are various techniques available for breast reconstruction, including implant-based reconstruction, autologous reconstruction (using the patient's own tissue), and a combination of both. Reconstruction can be performed immediately after mastectomy or at a later stage. Factors such as the extent of the mastectomy, the patient's overall health, and personal preferences influence the choice of reconstruction technique. Breast reconstruction can have a positive impact on a woman's physical and emotional well-being, helping to improve self-esteem and body image after breast cancer treatment.;0.017;198.0;117.0;0.289;0.042;0.171;0.756;0.06;-0.009;0.127

All dialysis and transplant centers have a dietitian. The dietitian helps people with kidney failure learn about healthy food choices. You should talk with your centers dietitian to make a meal plan.
                
The best diet for you will depend on which kidney failure treatment you choose after talking with your doctor.
                
- Hemodialysis      - Limit how much liquid and water you drink. Fluid can build up in your body between hemodialysis sessions. Also, many foods contain water. The extra fluid in your body can cause swelling and high blood pressure. Extra fluid in your body makes your heart work harder.
                
-      - Limit sodium, or salt. Watch out for sodium in frozen foods and prepared meals. You can also find sodium in canned foods, hot dogs, and fast food. Sodium makes you thirsty, which makes you drink more water and other liquids than you should.    - Read more in the National Kidney Disease Education Program (NKDEP) fact sheet Sodium.    - Limit potassium. Potassium is found in many fruits and vegetables such as potatoes, tomatoes, oranges, and bananas. Too much potassium can make your heart beat unevenly. Hemodialysis does not remove potassium from your body well.    - Read more in the NKDEP fact sheet Potassium.    - Eat protein-rich foods such as meat, fish, and eggs. Hemodialysis removes protein from your body.    - Read more in the NKDEP fact sheet Protein.    - Limit phosphorus. Phosphorus helps your bones, blood vessels, and muscles work.    - However, too much phosphorus can make your bones weak. Limiting phosphorus can be hard. Foods that contain phosphorus, such as meat and milk, also contain protein that you need. You should be careful to eat enough protein, yet not so much that you get too much phosphorus. You can avoid other foods that contain phosphorus, such as cola, tea, beans, and nuts.    - Read more in the NKDEP fact sheet Phosphorus.    - Find healthy ways to add calories to your diet. Calories are found in all foods and give your body energy. Many people on hemodialysis do not have a good appetite and do not get enough calories. Vegetable oils are good sources of calories. Vegetable oils include olive oil, canola oil, and safflower oil. Use them on breads, rice, and noodles. Hard candy, sugar, honey, jam, and jelly provide calories and energy. However, if you have diabetes, speak with your doctor or dietitian before eating extra sweets.    - More information about nutrition for people who are on hemodialysis is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Eat Right to Feel Right on Hemodialysis.    - Peritoneal dialysis      - Drink as much water and other liquids as you need. If you are holding too much fluid or too little fluid, your doctor needs to know.    - Limit sodium to control your thirst and help prevent heart problems. You can use spices other than salt to flavor your food.
                
-      - You may need to eat more potassium-rich foods. Peritoneal dialysis removes potassium from your body. Talk with your doctor or dietitian about the right amount of potassium for you.    - Eat protein-rich foods. Peritoneal dialysis removes even more protein from your body than hemodialysis.    - Limit phosphorus to keep your bones strong.    - You may need to limit your calorie intake. The salty water also contains some sugar. Your body absorbs the sugar, which can cause you to gain weight.    - Kidney transplant      - Limit sodium to help prevent heart problems.    - You should be able to eat normal amounts of phosphorus and potassium. You may need to adjust the amounts if blood tests show a problem.
                
-      - Eat protein-rich foods to repair muscle breakdown and protect against infection.    - You may need to limit your calories. The medicines you take can make you gain weight.    - Conservative management      - Limit protein to prevent the buildup of wastes in your blood.
                
You may have other needs and limits, depending on how well your treatments work.";Kidney failure, also known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD), occurs when your kidneys are no longer able to function properly. Treatment options include dialysis, which helps filter waste products and excess fluid from your blood, and a kidney transplant, which involves surgically placing a healthy kidney from a donor into your body. Dialysis can be performed in two ways: hemodialysis, which uses a machine to clean your blood outside of your body, or peritoneal dialysis, which uses your own peritoneal cavity (the space inside your abdomen) to filter waste products and excess fluid. A kidney transplant is the preferred treatment for kidney failure, but it's not always an option due to a shortage of donor kidneys.;0.0;620.0;107.0;0.211;0.027;0.138;0.412;-0.24;-0.378;-0.098

Migraines usually cause intense, throbbing pain in one area of the head, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. These recurrent headaches typically begin in childhood or adolescence and may last from a few hours to a few days. People with familial hemiplegic migraine experience an aura that comes before the headache. The most common symptoms associated with an aura are temporary visual changes such as blind spots (scotomas), flashing lights, zig-zagging lines, and double vision. In people with familial hemiplegic migraine, auras are also characterized by temporary numbness or weakness, often affecting one side of the body (hemiparesis). An aura typically develops gradually over a few minutes and lasts about an hour. Researchers have identified three forms of familial hemiplegic migraine known as FHM1, FHM2, and FHM3. Each of the three types is caused by mutations in a different gene.;Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) is a rare, inherited form of migraine characterized by recurrent episodes of paralysis or weakness on one side of the body, typically accompanied by migraine headache. FHM is caused by mutations in ion channel genes that regulate neuronal excitability, leading to abnormal electrical activity in the brain. FHM attacks typically begin in childhood or adolescence and can range in severity from mild to severe. Treatment options for FHM include medications to prevent or treat attacks, lifestyle modifications, and in some cases, surgery.;0.108;146.0;83.0;0.341;0.211;0.232;0.865;0.148;0.057;0.24

The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.;Camptodactyly taurinuria is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a combination of musculoskeletal and metabolic abnormalities. The primary symptom is a fixed flexion deformity of the fifth finger, known as camptodactyly. This deformity is typically present from birth and may be accompanied by limited mobility or pain in the affected finger. Additionally, individuals with Camptodactyly taurinuria may experience excessive sweating, muscle weakness, and susceptibility to heatstroke. Some cases may also involve intellectual disability, seizures, and vision problems.;0.005;203.0;71.0;0.213;0.032;0.142;0.648;-0.111;-0.231;0.012
355;gemini-pro;causes;What causes Urinary Tract Infections ?;Most urinary tract infections, or UTIs, are caused by bacteria that enter the urethra and then the bladder. A type of bacteria that normally lives in the bowel (called E. coli) causes most UTIs. UTIs can also be caused by fungus (another type of germ). Who Gets UTIs? Although everyone has some risk for UTIs, some people are more likely to get UTIs than others. These include people who have - spinal cord injuries or other nerve damage around the bladder.  - a blockage in the urinary tract that can trap urine in the bladder. The blockage can be caused by kidney stones, an enlarged prostate, or a birth defect.  - diabetes  - problems with the bodys natural defense (or immune) system  - pelvic organ prolapse, which is when pelvic organs (such as the bladder, rectum, or uterus) shift out of their normal position into the vagina. When pelvic organs are out of place, they can push on the bladder and urethra and make it hard to fully empty the bladder. This causes urine to stay in the bladder. When urine stays in the bladder too long, it makes an infection more likely spinal cord injuries or other nerve damage around the bladder. a blockage in the urinary tract that can trap urine in the bladder.

When pelvic organs are out of place, they can push on the bladder and urethra and make it hard to fully empty the bladder. This causes urine to stay in the bladder. When urine stays in the bladder too long, it makes an infection more likely UTIs in Women More than half of women will have at least one UTI in their lifetime. Women are more likely than men to get UTIs because they have a shorter urethra, making it easier for bacteria to reach the bladder. Also, the bowel and urethral openings are closer together in women than in men, making it easier for E. coli (a bacteria that lives in the bowel) to travel from the bowel to the urethra. Many women suffer from frequent UTIs. Some women have 3 or more UTIs a year. However, very few women will have frequent UTIs throughout their lives. More typically, a woman will have a period of 1 or 2 years with frequent UTIs. After this period, the UTIs may stop or happen less often. Older women are more likely to get UTIs because the bladder muscles weaken and make it hard to fully empty the bladder. This causes urine to stay in the bladder. When urine stays in the bladder too long, it makes an infection more likely. UTIs in Men Men are less likely than women to have a first UTI. But once a man has a UTI, he is likely to have another. Bacteria from a UTI can spread to the prostate. Once there, the bacteria can hide deep inside prostate tissue. Prostate infections are hard to cure because antibiotics may not be able to reach the infected prostate tissue. Activities That Can Increase Risk - Having sex. Sexual activity can move bacteria from the bowel or vaginal cavity to the urethral opening. Urinating after sex lowers the risk of infection.  - Using a catheter to urinate. A catheter is a tube placed in the urethra and bladder to help people empty the bladder. The catheter can make a direct path for bacteria to reach the bladder.  - Using certain birth controls. Diaphragms can bring bacteria with them when they are placed. Spermicides (a birth control that kills sperm) may also make UTIs more likely. Having sex.

Escherichia coli (E. coli), a type of bacteria commonly found in the digestive system, is the most frequent culprit. Other bacteria, such as Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, can also cause UTIs. Sexual activity, poor hygiene, a compromised immune system, certain medical conditions like diabetes, and structural abnormalities in the urinary tract can increase the risk of developing a UTI. Additionally, using a diaphragm or spermicide for contraception, as well as menopause, can contribute to an increased susceptibility to UTIs.;0.0;641.0;88.0;0.277;0.077;0.202;0.799;-0.165;-0.247;-0.084

Medications such as beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers are often prescribed to slow the heart rate and prevent arrhythmias. In some cases, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) may be recommended to monitor the heart rhythm and deliver electric shocks if a life-threatening arrhythmia occurs. Additionally, avoiding triggers such as caffeine, alcohol, and strenuous exercise may also help reduce the risk of developing tachycardic episodes.;0.024;59.0;74.0;0.143;0.035;0.102;0.608;-0.152;-0.101;-0.207
357;gemini-pro;treatment;What are the treatments for Narcolepsy ?;There is no cure for narcolepsy. In 1999, after successful clinical trial results, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a drug called modafinil for the treatment of EDS. Two classes of antidepressant drugs have proved effective in controlling cataplexy in many patients: tricyclics (including imipramine, desipramine, clomipramine, and protriptyline) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (including fluoxetine and sertraline). Drug therapy should be supplemented by behavioral strategies. For example, many people with narcolepsy take short, regularly scheduled naps at times when they tend to feel sleepiest. Improving the quality of nighttime sleep can combat EDS and help relieve persistent feelings of fatigue. Among the most important common-sense measures people with narcolepsy can take to enhance sleep quality are actions such as maintaining a regular sleep schedule, and avoiding alcohol and caffeine-containing beverages before bedtime. The drug Xyrem (sodium oxybate or gamma hydroxybutyrate, also known as GHB) was approved in July 2002 for treating cataplexy and in November 2005 for EDS in people who have narcolepsy. Due to safety concerns associated with the use of this drug, the distribution of Xyrem is tightly restricted.;Narcolepsy, a chronic sleep disorder, can be managed through a combination of lifestyle adjustments, medications, and behavioral therapies. Lifestyle modifications involve maintaining a regular sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and creating a conducive sleep environment. Medications, such as stimulants like modafinil or methylphenidate, can help improve wakefulness during the day and reduce excessive daytime sleepiness. Additionally, sodium oxybate may be prescribed to help with nighttime sleep and reduce cataplexy, a sudden loss of muscle tone. Behavioral therapies, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and scheduled naps, can help manage daytime sleepiness and improve overall sleep quality. Support groups and educational resources can also provide valuable guidance and emotional support for individuals with narcolepsy.;0.027;175.0;106.0;0.29;0.074;0.11;0.81;0.032;-0.094;0.161
358;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) vitiligo ?;"Vitiligo is a condition that causes patchy loss of skin coloring (pigmentation). The average age of onset of vitiligo is in the mid-twenties, but it can appear at any age. It tends to progress over time, with larger areas of the skin losing pigment. Some people with vitiligo also have patches of pigment loss affecting the hair on their scalp or body.  Researchers have identified several forms of vitiligo. Generalized vitiligo (also called nonsegmental vitiligo), which is the most common form, involves loss of pigment (depigmentation) in patches of skin all over the body. Depigmentation typically occurs on the face, neck, and scalp, and around body openings such as the mouth and genitals. Sometimes pigment is lost in mucous membranes, such as the lips. Loss of pigmentation is also frequently seen in areas that tend to experience rubbing, impact, or other trauma, such as the hands, arms, and places where bones are close to the skin surface (bony prominences). Another form called segmental vitiligo is associated with smaller patches of depigmented skin that appear on one side of the body in a limited area; this occurs in about 10 percent of affected individuals.  Vitiligo is generally considered to be an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs. In people with vitiligo the immune system appears to attack the pigment cells (melanocytes) in the skin. About 15 to 25 percent of people with vitiligo are also affected by at least one other autoimmune disorder, particularly autoimmune thyroid disease, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, psoriasis, pernicious anemia, Addison disease, or systemic lupus erythematosus.  In the absence of other autoimmune conditions, vitiligo does not affect general health or physical functioning. However, concerns about appearance and ethnic identity are significant issues for many affected individuals.";Vitiligo is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by the loss of pigment in patches of skin, resulting in white or lighter patches on the skin. The condition is caused by the destruction of melanocytes, the cells responsible for producing melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color. Vitiligo can affect people of all ages, races, and genders, and can occur on any part of the body, although it most commonly affects areas exposed to the sun, such as the face, hands, and arms. The exact cause of vitiligo is unknown, but it is thought to be related to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treatment options for vitiligo vary depending on the individual and the extent of the condition, and may include topical or oral medications, phototherapy, or surgery.;0.016;279.0;115.0;0.303;0.065;0.139;0.843;0.038;-0.075;0.154

A person with nephrotic syndrome excretes more than half a teaspoon of albumin per day.    - hyperlipidemiaa condition in which a persons blood has more-than-normal amounts of fats and cholesterol.    - edemaswelling, typically in a persons legs, feet, or ankles and less often in the hands or face.    - hypoalbuminemiaa condition in which a persons blood has less-than-normal amounts of albumin.    - Other signs and symptoms of primary amyloidosis may include      - fatigue, or feeling tired    - shortness of breath    - low blood pressure    - numbness, tingling, or a burning sensation in the hands or feet    - weight loss    - The symptoms of dialysis-related amyloidosis may include      - pain, stiffness, and fluid in the joints.    - abnormal, fluid-containing sacs, called cysts, in some bones.    - carpal tunnel syndrome, caused by unusual buildup of amyloid proteins in the wrists. The symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome include numbness or tingling, sometimes associated with muscle weakness, in the fingers and hands.    - A health care provider diagnoses primary amyloidosis of the kidneys with      - a medical and family history    - a physical exam    - urinalysis    - blood tests    - a kidney biopsy    - A health care provider diagnoses dialysis-related amyloidosis with      - urinalysis    - blood tests    - imaging tests    - A health care provider treats primary amyloidosis of the kidneys with the following:      - medication therapy, including chemotherapy    - a stem cell transplant    - treating other conditions    - A health care provider treats dialysis-related amyloidosis with      - medication therapy    - newer, more effective hemodialysis filters    - surgery    - a kidney transplant;For amyloidosis and kidney disease, a multidisciplinary approach is crucial. Management often includes managing the underlying cause, if possible, and addressing the kidney involvement. Treatments may involve medications to slow the progression of the disease, such as corticosteroids or chemotherapy. Additionally, supportive care measures are important, including a low-salt diet, monitoring and management of fluid balance, and treatment of any complications, such as infections or heart failure. In advanced cases, dialysis or kidney transplantation may be considered. Regular monitoring of kidney function, proteinuria levels, and overall health is essential to assess the effectiveness of treatment and make any necessary adjustments.;0.003;252.0;93.0;0.158;0.007;0.079;0.551;-0.211;-0.285;-0.14

362;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to familial hemiplegic migraine ?;Mutations in the CACNA1A, ATP1A2, SCN1A, and PRRT2 genes have been found to cause familial hemiplegic migraine. The first three genes provide instructions for making proteins that are involved in the transport of charged atoms (ions) across cell membranes. The movement of these ions is critical for normal signaling between nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and other parts of the nervous system. The function of the protein produced from the PRRT2 gene is unknown, although studies suggest it interacts with a protein that helps control signaling between neurons.  Communication between neurons depends on chemicals called neurotransmitters, which are released from one neuron and taken up by neighboring neurons. Researchers believe that mutations in the CACNA1A, ATP1A2, and SCN1A genes can upset the balance of ions in neurons, which disrupts the normal release and uptake of certain neurotransmitters in the brain. Although the mechanism is unknown, researchers speculate that mutations in the PRRT2 gene, which reduce the amount of PRRT2 protein, also disrupt normal control of neurotransmitter release. The resulting changes in signaling between neurons lead people with familial hemiplegic migraine to develop these severe headaches.  There is little evidence that mutations in the CACNA1A, ATP1A2, SCN1A, and PRRT2 genes play a role in common migraines, which affect millions of people each year. Researchers are searching for additional genetic changes that may underlie rare types of migraine, such as familial hemiplegic migraine, as well as the more common forms of migraine.;Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) is a rare subtype of migraine with aura characterized by hemiparesis or other focal neurological symptoms that precede or accompany the headache. FHM is caused by mutations in three genes: CACNA1A, ATP1A2, and SCN1A. CACNA1A encodes the alpha-1A subunit of the voltage-gated calcium channel Cav2.1, which is expressed in neurons and smooth muscle cells. ATP1A2 encodes the alpha-2 subunit of the sodium-potassium ATPase pump, which is responsible for maintaining the sodium and potassium gradients across cell membranes. SCN1A encodes the alpha-1 subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1, which is expressed in neurons and is responsible for the initiation and propagation of action potentials. Mutations in these genes can lead to changes in the function of these ion channels, resulting in neuronal hyperexcitability and the development of migraine attacks.;0.03;220.0;121.0;0.322;0.1;0.181;0.806;0.022;0.041;0.0
363;gemini-pro;causes;What causes Tarsal tunnel syndrome ?;What causes tarsal tunnel syndrome? There are a variety of factors that may cause tarsal tunnel syndrome. These may include repetitive stress with activities, trauma (e.g., crush injury, stretch injury, fractures, ankle dislocations or sprains), flat feet, and excess weight. Additionally, any lesion that occupies space within the tarsal tunnel region may cause pressure on the nerve and subsequent symptoms. Examples include tendonitis, hematoma, tumor, varicose veins, and lower extremity edema.;Tarsal tunnel syndrome arises from compression of the posterior tibial nerve. The posterior tibial nerve passes through a fibro-osseous tunnel, called the tarsal tunnel, located along the inside of the ankle, behind the medial malleolus (the bony prominence on the inside of the ankle). Causes of tarsal tunnel syndrome include conditions that cause swelling or inflammation in the tarsal tunnel, such as flat feet, high-arched feet, obesity, pregnancy, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, bone spurs, and injuries to the ankle. The posterior tibial nerve may also be compressed by repetitive ankle movements.;0.044;68.0;78.0;0.306;0.046;0.18;0.861;0.065;0.106;0.02
364;gemini-pro;symptoms;What are the symptoms of McCune Albright syndrome ?;"What are the signs and symptoms of McCune Albright syndrome? People with McCune Albright syndrome (MAS) may have symptoms related to bones, the endocrine system, and/or skin. The symptoms can range from mild to severe. Bone symptoms may include: Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia: This is when normal bone is replaced by softer, fibrous tissue. Polyostotic means the abnormal areas may occur in many bones; often they are confined to one side of the body. Replacement of bone with fibrous tissue may lead to fractures, uneven growth, and deformity. When it occurs in skull and jaw it can result in uneven growth of the face. This may also occur in the long bones; uneven growth of leg bones may cause limping. Abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis) Cancer: Bone lesions may become cancerous, but this happens in less than 1% of people with MAS. Endocrine symptoms may include: Early puberty: Girls with MAS usually reach puberty early. They often have menstrual bleeding by age 2 (as early as 4-6 months in some), many years before characteristics such as breast enlargement and pubic hair growth are evident. This early onset of menstruation is believed to be caused by excess estrogen, a female sex hormone produced by cysts that develop in one of the ovaries. Less commonly, boys with MAS may also experience early puberty. Enlarged thyroid gland: The thyroid gland may become enlarged (a condition called a goiter) or develop masses called nodules. About half of affected individuals produce excessive amounts of thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism), resulting in a fast heart rate, high blood pressure, weight loss, tremors, sweating, and other symptoms. Increased production of growth hormone: The pituitary gland may produce too much growth hormone. This can result in acromegaly, a condition characterized by large hands and feet, arthritis, and distinctive facial features that are often described as ""coarse."" Cushings syndrome: Rarely, individuals with MAS produce too much of the hormone cortisol in the adrenal glands. Cushing's syndrome causes weight gain in the face and upper body, slowed growth in children, fragile skin, fatigue, and other health problems. Skin symptoms may include: Cafe-au-lait spots: Individuals with MAS usually have light brown patches of skin called cafe-au-lait spots. Like the bone lesions, these spots often appear on only one side of the body. Most children have these spots from birth and the spots rarely grow. There are usually not any medical problems caused by these skin changes. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for McCune Albright syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition.

The paralysis slowly improves. Botulism can be treated with an antitoxin which blocks the action of toxin circulating in the blood. Antitoxin for infants is available from the California Department of Public Health, and antitoxin for older children and adults is available through CDC.If given before paralysis is complete, antitoxin can prevent worsening and shorten recovery time. Physicians may try to remove contaminated food still in the gut by inducing vomiting or by using enemas. Wounds should be treated, usually surgically, to remove the source of the toxin-producing bacteria followed by administration of appropriate antibiotics. Good supportive care in a hospital is the mainstay of therapy for all forms of botulism.;Botulism is a serious paralytic illness caused by a nerve toxin that is produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. Treatment for botulism typically involves supportive care, such as mechanical ventilation and nutritional support, as well as the administration of antitoxin to neutralize the botulinum toxin.

Losing weightat least 5 to 10 percent of your starting weightcan prevent or delay diabetes or even reverse prediabetes. Thats 10 to 20 pounds for someone who weighs 200 pounds. You can lose weight by cutting the amount of calories and fat you consume and by being physically active at least 30 to 60 minutes every day. Physical activity also helps your body use the hormone insulin properly. Your body needs insulin to use glucose for energy. Medicine can help control the amount of glucose in your blood. Ask your doctor if medicine to control glucose is right for you. Learn more about prediabetes here.;Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by elevated blood sugar levels. There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. In type 1 diabetes, the body's immune system attacks and destroys the beta cells in the pancreas, which produce insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose, or sugar, enter cells for energy. Without insulin, glucose builds up in the blood and can lead to serious complications. In type 2 diabetes, the body does not produce enough insulin or does not use insulin well. This can also lead to high blood sugar levels and complications.;0.016;148.0;92.0;0.302;0.027;0.151;0.617;-0.055;-0.146;0.036

Its signs and symptoms appear after the first few months of life.  Hepatic veno-occlusive disease is a condition that blocks (occludes) small veins in the liver, disrupting blood flow in this organ. This condition can lead to enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly), a buildup of scar tissue (hepatic fibrosis), and liver failure.  Children with VODI are prone to recurrent infections caused by certain bacteria, viruses, and fungi. The organisms that cause infection in people with this disorder are described as opportunistic because they ordinarily do not cause illness in healthy people. These infections are usually serious and may be life-threatening. In most people with VODI, infections occur before hepatic veno-occlusive disease becomes evident.  Many people with VODI live only into childhood, although some affected individuals have lived to early adulthood.;Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) with immunodeficiency is a rare inherited disorder characterized by congestion of blood flow in the liver due to narrowing or blockage of small hepatic veins. This leads to increased pressure in the liver, liver damage, and impaired liver function. The immunodeficiency associated with this condition can result in recurrent infections and an increased risk of certain types of cancer.

Many people with acatalasemia never have any health problems related to the condition and are diagnosed because they have affected family members.  Some of the first reported individuals with acatalasemia developed open sores (ulcers) inside the mouth that led to the death of soft tissue (gangrene). When mouth ulcers and gangrene occur with acatalasemia, the condition is known as Takahara disease. These complications are rarely seen in more recent cases of acatalasemia, probably because of improvements in oral hygiene.  Studies suggest that people with acatalasemia have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is the most common form of diabetes. A higher percentage of people with acatalasemia have type 2 diabetes mellitus than in the general population, and the disease tends to develop at an earlier age (in a person's thirties or forties, on average). Researchers speculate that acatalasemia could also be a risk factor for other common, complex diseases; however, only a small number of cases have been studied.";Acatalasemia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency or complete absence of the enzyme catalase in red blood cells and other tissues. Catalase is responsible for the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide, a toxic byproduct of cellular metabolism, into water and oxygen.

382;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Rett Syndrome ?;Rett syndrome is a childhood neurodevelopmental disorder that affects females almost exclusively. The child generally appears to grow and develop normally, before symptoms begin. Loss of muscle tone is usually the first symptom. Other early symptoms may include a slowing of development, problems crawling or walking, and diminished eye contact. As the syndrome progresses, a child will lose purposeful use of her hands and the ability to speak. Compulsive hand movements such as wringing and washing follow the loss of functional use of the hands. The inability to perform motor functions is perhaps the most severely disabling feature of Rett syndrome, interfering with every body movement, including eye gaze and speech.;Rett syndrome is a rare neurological disorder characterized by a period of normal development followed by regression of motor skills, autistic-like features, and intellectual disability. It primarily affects females and is caused by mutations in the gene MECP2, located on the X chromosome. Symptoms typically manifest between 6 and 18 months of age and include loss of purposeful hand skills, impaired coordination, and repetitive movements. Affected individuals may also experience seizures, respiratory problems, and gastrointestinal issues. Currently, there is no cure for Rett syndrome, but supportive therapies can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.;0.03;100.0;92.0;0.238;0.043;0.146;0.849;0.128;0.141;0.113

Affected individuals usually have thrombocytopenia, in which there are abnormally low numbers of blood cells called platelets. Platelets are involved in normal blood clotting; a shortage of platelets typically results in easy bruising and abnormal bleeding. In addition, affected individuals often have a muscle disorder, called tubular aggregate myopathy, that leads to muscle weakness. Another feature of Stormorken syndrome is permanent constriction of the pupils of the eyes (miosis), which may be caused by abnormalities in the muscles that control the size of the pupils. Other features include lack of a functioning spleen (asplenia), scaly skin (ichthyosis), headaches, and difficulty with reading and spelling (dyslexia).";Stormorken syndrome is an extremely rare congenital disorder characterized by skeletal anomalies, distinctive facial features, intellectual disability, and delayed development.

384;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Prosthetic joint infection ?;A prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a rare complication of joint replacement surgery, also known as arthroplasty.  Arthroplasty is done to help relieve pain and restore function in a severely diseased joint, such as a knee, hip or shoulder.  Approximately 0.5 to 1 percent of people with replacement joints develop a PJI.  Infections can occur early in the course of recovery from joint replacement surgery (within the first two months) or much later.  Signs and symptoms of PJI include fever, chills, drainage from the surgical site, and increasing redness, tenderness, swelling and pain of the affected joint.  Prosthetic joint infections are often hard to treat because of the development of a structure called a biofilm within the joint. A biofilm develops when bacteria adhere to the solid surface of the artificial joint. The biofilm can act as a kind of shield to some of the bacteria, making it difficult for the bacteria to be found and destroyed by the body's defenses or by antibiotic medications. An infected joint replacement usually requires surgery to remove the artificial parts and potent antibiotics to kill the bacteria.;Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a severe complication following joint replacement surgery, characterized by the presence of microorganisms within the prosthetic joint and surrounding tissues. PJI can be caused by a variety of bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Gram-negative organisms. The symptoms of PJI typically include pain, swelling, redness, and warmth around the affected joint. PJI can lead to significant morbidity, including implant failure, chronic pain, and functional limitations.;0.03;160.0;65.0;0.288;0.102;0.209;0.872;0.125;0.075;0.174
385;gemini-pro;research;what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Prostate Cancer ?;Scientists continue to look at new ways to prevent, treat, and diagnose prostate cancer. Research has already led to a number of advances in these areas. Dietary Research Several studies are under way to explore the causes of prostate cancer. Some researchers think that diet may affect a man's chances of developing prostate cancer. For example, some studies show that prostate cancer is more common in populations that consume a high-fat diet, particularly animal fat, and in populations with diets that lack certain nutrients. Research on Testosterone Some research suggests that high levels of testosterone may increase a man's risk of prostate cancer. The difference in prostate cancer risk among racial groups could be related to high testosterone levels, but it also could result from diet or other lifestyle factors. Genetic Research Researchers are studying changes in genes that may increase the risk for developing prostate cancer. Some studies are looking at the genes of men who were diagnosed with prostate cancer at a relatively young age, such as less than 55 years old, and the genes of families who have several members with the disease. Other studies are trying to identify which genes, or arrangements of genes, are most likely to lead to prostate cancer. Much more work is needed, however, before scientists can say exactly how genetic changes relate to prostate cancer. Prevention Research Several studies have explored ways to prevent prostate cancer. In October 2008, initial results of a study on the use of the dietary supplements vitamin E and selenium found that they did not provide any benefit in reducing the number of new cases of the disease. A few studies suggest that a diet that regularly includes tomato-based foods may help protect men from prostate cancer, but there are no studies that conclusively prove this hypothesis. According to results of a study that was re-analyzed in 2013, men who took finasteride, a drug that affects male hormone levels, reduced their chances of getting prostate cancer by nearly 30 percent compared to men who took a placebo. Unlike earlier findings from this study, this new analysis showed no increased risk of late stage disease due to use of finasteride. Stopping Prostate Cancer from Returning Scientists are also looking at ways to stop prostate cancer from returning in men who have already been treated for the disease. These approaches use drugs such as finasteride, flutamide, nilutamide, and LH-RH agonists that manipulate hormone levels. In 2010, the FDA approved a therapeutic cancer vaccine, Provenge, for use in some men with metastatic prostate cancer. Provenge may provide a 4-month improvement in overall survival compared with a placebo vaccine. Other similar vaccine therapies are in development. Research on New Blood Tests Some researchers are working to develop new blood tests to detect the antibodies that the immune system produces to fight prostate cancer. When used along with PSA testing, the antibody tests may provide more accurate results about whether or not a man has prostate cancer. Researching New Approaches to Treatment Through research, doctors are trying to find new, more effective ways to treat prostate cancer. Cryosurgery -- destroying cancer by freezing it -- is under study as an alternative to surgery and radiation therapy. To avoid damaging healthy tissue, the doctor places an instrument known as a cryoprobe in direct contact with the tumor to freeze it. Doctors are studying new ways of using radiation therapy and hormonal therapy, too. Studies have shown that hormonal therapy given after radiation therapy can help certain men whose cancer has spread to nearby tissues. Scientists are also testing the effectiveness of chemotherapy and biological therapy for men whose cancer does not respond, or stops responding, to hormonal therapy. They are also exploring new ways to schedule and combine various treatments. For example, they are studying hormonal therapy to find out if using it to shrink the tumor before a man has surgery or radiation might be a useful approach. For men with early stage prostate cancer, researchers are also comparing treatment with watchful waiting. The results of this work will help doctors know whether to treat early stage prostate cancer immediately or only later on, if symptoms occur or worsen.;"There are numerous ongoing research and clinical trials dedicated to advancing the understanding and treatment of Prostate Cancer. These investigations encompass various aspects of the disease, including: 

- Novel therapeutic approaches: Studies are exploring targeted therapies that selectively inhibit the growth and spread of prostate cancer cells. These therapies may involve monoclonal antibodies, small molecule inhibitors, and immunotherapies that enhance the immune system's ability to recognize and attack cancer cells. 

- Improved screening and diagnostic methods: Research aims to develop more accurate and reliable screening tools for early detection of prostate cancer. This includes the investigation of biomarkers, genetic testing, and imaging techniques to identify individuals at higher risk of the disease. 

- Personalized medicine: Clinical trials are evaluating the use of genetic profiling and molecular analysis to tailor treatment strategies to the specific characteristics of each patient's cancer. This approach aims to enhance treatment effectiveness and reduce side effects by matching therapies to the unique molecular makeup of the tumor. 

- Minimizing treatment side effects: Research efforts are focused on developing treatments that minimize the adverse effects associated with prostate cancer therapy. Studies are investigating strategies to reduce urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, and other side effects commonly experienced during or after treatment. 

- Improving outcomes for advanced disease: Clinical trials are evaluating new treatment modalities and combinations for patients with advanced or metastatic prostate cancer. These studies aim to prolong survival, improve quality of life, and identify potential curative approaches.";0.005;656.0;225.0;0.236;0.031;0.093;0.566;-0.051;-0.11;0.006
386;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to Rotor syndrome ?;"The SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3 genes are involved in Rotor syndrome. Mutations in both genes are required for the condition to occur. The SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3 genes provide instructions for making similar proteins, called organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) and organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B3 (OATP1B3), respectively. Both proteins are found in liver cells; they transport bilirubin and other compounds from the blood into the liver so that they can be cleared from the body. In the liver, bilirubin is dissolved in a digestive fluid called bile and then excreted from the body.  The SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3 gene mutations that cause Rotor syndrome lead to abnormally short, nonfunctional OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 proteins or an absence of these proteins. Without the function of either transport protein, bilirubin is less efficiently taken up by the liver and removed from the body. The buildup of this substance leads to jaundice in people with Rotor syndrome.";In Rotor syndrome, a rare inherited liver disorder, the genetic mutation responsible is found in the SLCO1B1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called the bile salt export pump (BSEP), which resides in the liver cell membranes. The mutations in the SLCO1B1 gene lead to a defective BSEP protein, resulting in impaired transport of bile acids from liver cells into bile ducts and consequently reduced bile flow. As a result, bile acids accumulate in the liver and blood, causing liver damage and jaundice, a condition characterized by yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes. The genetic changes in Rotor syndrome are primarily missense mutations, leading to the production of a nonfunctional or partially functional BSEP protein.;0.036;137.0;104.0;0.405;0.102;0.196;0.777;0.142;0.102;0.18

Through a process called fermentation, yeast converts the sugars naturally found in grains and grapes into the alcohol that is in beer and wine. Another process, called distillation, concentrates alcohol in the drink making it stronger, producing what are known as distilled spirits.;Alcohol Use and Older Adults: Alcohol consumption patterns and their associated health effects differ among older adults compared to younger populations. Older adults may be more susceptible to alcohol's effects due to physiological changes, medication interactions, and co-occurring health conditions. Moderate alcohol consumption in older adults may have potential cardiovascular benefits. However, excessive alcohol use can increase the risk of falls, cognitive impairment, liver damage, and various chronic diseases. Understanding the unique risks and benefits of alcohol use in older adults is crucial for healthcare providers to provide appropriate guidance and interventions to promote healthy aging and prevent alcohol-related harms.;0.007;61.0;98.0;0.073;0.0;0.055;0.397;-0.224;-0.197;-0.255
391;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 ?;"Mutations in one of four different genes involved in sodium regulation cause autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive PHA1. Mutations in the NR3C2 gene cause autosomal dominant PHA1. This gene provides instructions for making the mineralocorticoid receptor protein. Mutations in the SCNN1A, SCNN1B, or SCNN1G genes cause autosomal recessive PHA1. Each of these three genes provides instructions for making one of the pieces (subunits) of a protein complex called the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC).  The mineralocorticoid receptor regulates specialized proteins in the cell membrane that control the transport of sodium or potassium into cells. In response to signals that sodium levels are low, such as the presence of the hormone aldosterone, the mineralocorticoid receptor increases the number and activity of these proteins at the cell membrane of certain kidney cells. One of these proteins is ENaC, which transports sodium into the cell; another protein simultaneously transports sodium out of the cell and potassium into the cell. These proteins help keep sodium in the body through a process called reabsorption and remove potassium from the body through a process called secretion.  Mutations in the NR3C2 gene lead to a nonfunctional or abnormally functioning mineralocorticoid receptor protein that cannot properly regulate the specialized proteins that transport sodium and potassium. As a result, sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion are both decreased, causing hyponatremia and hyperkalemia.  Mutations in the SCNN1A, SCNN1B, and SCNN1G genes result in reduced functioning or nonfunctioning ENaC channels. As in autosomal dominant PHA1, the reduction or absence of ENaC function in the kidneys leads to hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. In addition, nonfunctional ENaC channels in other body systems lead to additional signs and symptoms of autosomal recessive PHA1, including lung infections and skin lesions.";Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the genes encoding the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) subunits, which are responsible for sodium reabsorption in the kidneys. These mutations result in impaired sodium reabsorption, leading to excessive loss of sodium and water in the urine, and consequently, low blood pressure, dehydration, and elevated levels of potassium in the blood. The most common genetic change associated with PHA1 is a mutation in the SCNN1B gene, which encodes the beta subunit of ENaC. Other genetic changes that have been linked to PHA1 include mutations in the SCNN1A, SCNN1G, and SCNN1D genes, which encode the alpha, gamma, and delta subunits of ENaC, respectively. These mutations disrupt the normal function of ENaC, leading to the symptoms of PHA1.;0.019;254.0;114.0;0.328;0.083;0.201;0.753;-0.001;-0.093;0.092

However, general treatment approaches may include: 1. IUGR: For mild cases, increased maternal nutrition and rest may be recommended. In severe cases, interventions such as amniocentesis to reduce excess amniotic fluid, or preterm delivery may be considered. 2. Metaphyseal Dysplasia: Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and improving mobility. Physical therapy, orthopedic care, and surgical interventions to correct bone deformities may be necessary. 3. Adrenal Hypoplasia Congenita: Hormone replacement therapy with corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids is the primary treatment.

394;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is Mitochondrial complex II deficiency inherited ?;What causes mitochondrial complex II deficiency? Many genes must work together to ensure that the enzyme, complex II (succinate dehydrogenase), can perform its job normally in the body. Changes in the SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF1, and SDHAF2 genes can all potentially cause complex II deficiency. Complex II deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. This means that a person must inherit a gene mutation from both their mother and father in order to develop complex II deficiency. People who have a single mutation are called carriers. Carriers of complex II deficiency may be at an increased risk for certain health problems, including for paragangliomas and/or pheochromocytomas.[8676];Yes, mitochondrial complex II deficiency is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that both copies of the gene encoding complex II subunits must have mutations in order for the disorder to manifest. In some cases, the inheritance pattern can be mitochondrial, meaning that the mutations are located in mitochondrial DNA and are passed down from mother to child, affecting both males and females. Rarely, complex II deficiency can be caused by mutations in nuclear genes that are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, requiring only one mutated copy of the gene to cause the disorder.;0.103;100.0;90.0;0.418;0.117;0.239;0.729;0.093;-0.022;0.21
395;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) microvillus inclusion disease ?;Microvillus inclusion disease is a condition characterized by chronic, watery, life-threatening diarrhea typically beginning in the first hours to days of life. Rarely, the diarrhea starts around age 3 or 4 months. Food intake increases the frequency of diarrhea.  Microvillus inclusion disease prevents the absorption of nutrients from food during digestion, resulting in malnutrition and dehydration. Affected infants often have difficulty gaining weight and growing at the expected rate (failure to thrive), developmental delay, liver and kidney problems, and thinning of the bones (osteoporosis). Some affected individuals develop cholestasis, which is a reduced ability to produce and release a digestive fluid called bile. Cholestasis leads to irreversible liver disease (cirrhosis).  In individuals with microvillus inclusion disease, lifelong nutritional support is needed and given through intravenous feedings (parenteral nutrition). Even with nutritional supplementation, most children with microvillus inclusion disease do not survive beyond childhood.  A variant of microvillus inclusion disease with milder diarrhea often does not require full-time parenteral nutrition. Individuals with the variant type frequently live past childhood.;Microvillus inclusion disease (MVID) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by chronic, severe diarrhea due to the absence or significant reduction of microvilli on the surface of the small intestinal epithelial cells. This leads to impaired absorption of nutrients and electrolytes, resulting in malnutrition, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances. MVID is caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins essential for microvilli formation and function, leading to abnormal differentiation and maturation of intestinal epithelial cells. Treatment typically involves dietary management, including specialized formulas and nutritional supplements, as well as supportive care to address dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. In severe cases, intestinal transplantation may be considered as a potential treatment option.;0.029;157.0;103.0;0.23;0.075;0.208;0.698;-0.063;-0.127;-0.002

Affected children often experience delayed development of motor skills (such as crawling and walking), although most eventually acquire these skills. Moebius syndrome is caused by the absence or underdevelopment of the 6th and 7th cranial nerves, which control eye movement and facial expression. Other cranial nerves may also be affected. There is no cure for Moebius syndrome, but proper care and treatment give many individuals a normal life expectancy.";Moebius syndrome is a rare neurological disorder characterized by facial paralysis and an inability to move the eyes sideways. It is caused by a failure of the sixth and seventh cranial nerves to develop properly during fetal development. This results in a weakness or paralysis of the muscles that control facial expression and eye movement. In some cases, Moebius syndrome can also affect other parts of the body, such as the hands and feet.

Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.    Plasma cell neoplasms are most common in people who are middle aged or older.

399;gemini-pro;susceptibility;Who is at risk for Overweight and Obesity? ?;"Being overweight or obese isn't a cosmetic problem. These conditions greatly raise your risk for other health problems.
                
Overweight and Obesity-Related Health Problems in Adults
                
Coronary Heart Disease
                
As your body mass index rises, so does your risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). CHD is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque (plak) builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart.
                
Plaque can narrow or block the coronary arteries and reduce blood flow to the heart muscle. This can cause angina (an-JI-nuh or AN-juh-nuh) or a heart attack. (Angina is chest pain or discomfort.)
                
Obesity also can lead to heart failure. This is a serious condition in which your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs.
                
High Blood Pressure
                
Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as theheart pumps blood. If this pressure rises and stays high over time, it can damage the body in many ways.
                
Your chances of having high blood pressure are greater if you're overweight or obese.
                
Stroke
                
Being overweight or obese can lead to a buildup of plaque in your arteries. Eventually, an area of plaque can rupture, causing a blood clot to form.
                
If the clot is close to your brain, it can block the flow of blood and oxygen to your brain and cause a stroke. The risk of having a stroke rises as BMI increases.
                
Type 2 Diabetes
                
Diabetes is a disease in which the body's blood glucose, or blood sugar, level is too high. Normally, the body breaks down food into glucose and then carries it to cells throughout the body. The cells use a hormone called insulin to turn the glucose into energy.
                
In type 2 diabetes, the body's cells don't use insulin properly. At first, the body reacts by making more insulin. Over time, however, the body can't make enough insulin to control its blood sugar level.
                
Diabetes is a leading cause of early death, CHD, stroke, kidney disease, and blindness. Most people who have type 2 diabetes are overweight.
                
Abnormal Blood Fats
                
If you're overweight or obese, you're at increased risk of having abnormal levels of blood fats. These include high levels of triglycerides and LDL (""bad"") cholesterol and low levels of HDL (""good"") cholesterol.
                
Abnormal levels of these blood fats are a risk factor for CHD. For more information about triglycerides and LDL and HDL cholesterol, go to the Health Topics High Blood Cholesterol article.
                
Metabolic Syndrome
                
Metabolic syndrome is the name for a group of risk factors that raises your risk for heart disease and other health problems, such as diabetes and stroke.
                
You can develop any one of these risk factors by itself, but they tend to occur together. A diagnosis of metabolic syndrome is made if you have at least three of the following risk factors:
                
A large waistline. This is called abdominal obesity or ""having an apple shape."" Having extra fat in the waist area is a greater risk factor for CHD than having extra fat in other parts of the body, such as on the hips.
                
A higher than normal triglyceride level (or you're on medicine to treat high triglycerides).
                
A lower than normal HDL cholesterol level (or you're on medicine to treat low HDL cholesterol).
                
Higher than normal blood pressure (or you're on medicine to treat high blood pressure).
                
Higher than normal fasting blood sugar (or you're on medicine to treat diabetes).
                
Cancer
                
Being overweight or obese raises your risk for colon, breast, endometrial, and gallbladder cancers.
                
Osteoarthritis
                
Osteoarthritis is a common joint problem of the knees, hips, and lower back. The condition occurs if the tissue that protects the joints wears away. Extra weight can put more pressure and wear on joints, causing pain.
                
Sleep Apnea
                
Sleep apnea is a common disorder in which you have one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep.
                
A person who has sleep apnea may have more fat stored around the neck. This can narrow the airway, making it hard to breathe.
                
Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome
                
Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is a breathing disorder that affects some obese people. In OHS, poor breathing results in too much carbon dioxide (hypoventilation) and too little oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia).
                
OHS can lead to serious health problems and may even cause death.
                
Reproductive Problems
                
Obesity can cause menstrual issues and infertility in women.
                
Gallstones
                
Gallstones are hard pieces of stone-like material that form in the gallbladder. They're mostly made of cholesterol. Gallstones can cause stomach or back pain.
                
People who are overweight or obese are at increased risk of having gallstones. Also, being overweight may result in an enlarged gallbladder that doesn't work well.
                
Overweight and Obesity-Related Health Problems in Children and Teens
                
Overweight and obesity also increase the health risks for children and teens. Type2 diabetes once was rare in American children, but an increasing number of children are developing the disease.
                
Also, overweight children are more likely to become overweight or obese as adults, with the same disease risks.";Individuals with a genetic predisposition, certain medical conditions, specific dietary habits, and sedentary lifestyles are at an increased risk of overweight and obesity. Genetic factors can influence body weight and metabolism, while medical conditions such as Cushing's syndrome, hypothyroidism, and certain medications can contribute to weight gain. Consuming a diet high in processed foods, added sugars, and unhealthy fats, coupled with inadequate physical activity, can lead to an imbalance between calorie intake and energy expenditure, promoting weight gain. Furthermore, factors like age, gender, socioeconomic status, and psychological factors can also influence an individual's risk of developing overweight or obesity.;0.0;784.0;94.0;0.15;0.027;0.105;0.419;-0.224;-0.349;-0.096

Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the skin - Autosomal dominant inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.;Syringoma typically presents as multiple, small, skin-colored or yellowish papules, ranging in size from 1 to 3 millimeters. These papules are usually found in clusters on the face, particularly around the eyes, cheeks, and nose. They may also occur on the neck, chest, and back. Syringomas are usually asymptomatic, but some people may experience mild itching or irritation. In rare cases, syringomas can become infected, leading to redness, swelling, and pain.;0.003;199.0;68.0;0.22;0.008;0.11;0.485;-0.216;-0.29;-0.143
402;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to Alagille syndrome ?;In more than 90 percent of cases, mutations in the JAG1 gene cause Alagille syndrome. Another 7 percent of individuals with Alagille syndrome have small deletions of genetic material on chromosome 20 that include the JAG1 gene. A few people with Alagille syndrome have mutations in a different gene, called NOTCH2. The JAG1 and NOTCH2 genes provide instructions for making proteins that fit together to trigger interactions called Notch signaling between neighboring cells during embryonic development. This signaling influences how the cells are used to build body structures in the developing embryo. Changes in either the JAG1 gene or NOTCH2 gene probably disrupt the Notch signaling pathway. As a result, errors may occur during development, especially affecting the bile ducts, heart, spinal column, and certain facial features.;Alagille syndrome, an inherited disorder that affects multiple organ systems, is caused by mutations in the JAG1 (Jagged1) or NOTCH2 (neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 2) genes. These genes are crucial for the signaling pathway that guides embryonic development, particularly in the formation of the liver, heart, eyes, and skeletal system. Mutations in either JAG1 or NOTCH2 disrupt this signaling, leading to developmental anomalies and functional impairments in the affected organs. The specific genetic changes associated with Alagille syndrome vary among individuals, and the severity of symptoms can range from mild to severe, depending on the type and location of the mutation.;0.045;116.0;92.0;0.357;0.103;0.204;0.859;0.142;0.141;0.14
403;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to Bart-Pumphrey syndrome ?;Bart-Pumphrey syndrome is caused by mutations in the GJB2 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called gap junction beta 2, more commonly known as connexin 26. Connexin 26 is a member of the connexin protein family. Connexin proteins form channels called gap junctions that permit the transport of nutrients, charged atoms (ions), and signaling molecules between neighboring cells that are in contact with each other. Gap junctions made with connexin 26 transport potassium ions and certain small molecules.  Connexin 26 is found in cells throughout the body, including the inner ear and the skin. In the inner ear, channels made from connexin 26 are found in a snail-shaped structure called the cochlea. These channels may help to maintain the proper level of potassium ions required for the conversion of sound waves to electrical nerve impulses. This conversion is essential for normal hearing. In addition, connexin 26 may be involved in the maturation of certain cells in the cochlea. Connexin 26 also plays a role in the growth, maturation, and stability of the outermost layer of skin (the epidermis).  The GJB2 gene mutations that cause Bart-Pumphrey syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the connexin 26 protein. The altered protein probably disrupts the function of normal connexin 26 in cells, and may interfere with the function of other connexin proteins. This disruption could affect skin growth and also impair hearing by disturbing the conversion of sound waves to nerve impulses.;Bart-Pumphrey syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by distinctive facial features, intellectual disability, delayed development, and skeletal abnormalities. The genetic changes associated with Bart-Pumphrey syndrome involve mutations in the CHD7 gene, which encodes a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. Specifically, mutations in CHD7 can result in the production of a non-functional protein, leading to disruptions in gene expression and the development of the characteristic features of the syndrome.;0.004;219.0;63.0;0.167;0.032;0.141;0.518;-0.041;-0.194;0.118
404;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Hartnup disease ?;"Hartnup disease is a metabolic disorder characterized by abnormal transport of certain amino acids in the kidney and gastrointestinal system. It is a type of aminoaciduria. The condition may be diagnosed based on the results of newborn screening tests. Most people with the condition have no symptoms (asymptomatic). For those who do show symptoms, the onset of the disease is usually between the ages of 3 and 9; occasionally the disease may present in adulthood. Mental development is usually normal, though a few cases with intellectual impairment have been reported. The signs and symptoms of Hartnup disease incude skin photosensitivity, neurologic findings, psychiatric symptoms, and ocular (eye) findings. Hartnup disease is caused by mutations in the SLC6A19 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.[1][2] People with Hartnup disease may benefit from a high-protein diet, protection from sunlight, vitamin supplementation, and avoidance of certain drugs/medications. In some cases, treatment with nicotinamide supplements and tryptophan ethyl ester may be indicated.";Hartnup disease is an inherited disorder in which the body is unable to properly absorb certain amino acids from the small intestine and reabsorb them from the kidneys. This results in an increased excretion of these amino acids in the urine and a deficiency of them in the body. The most common symptom of Hartnup disease is a skin rash that appears in a distinctive butterfly pattern across the nose and cheeks. Other symptoms can include diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and neurological problems such as tremors, seizures, and intellectual disability. Treatment typically involves dietary modifications, such as avoiding foods that are high in the amino acids that the body cannot properly absorb, as well as supplementation with the amino acids that are deficient.;0.035;145.0;108.0;0.235;0.06;0.176;0.825;0.085;0.001;0.168
405;gemini-pro;causes;What causes Progressive deafness with stapes fixation ?;What causes deafness, progressive with stapes fixation? The exact cause of deafness, progressive with stapes fixation depends on whether it is associated with an underlying condition or infection. Isolated cases may be inherited.  Autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked cases have been reported. In some cases, no underlying cause can be identified.;Progressive deafness with stapes fixation is primarily caused by otosclerosis, a condition characterized by the abnormal growth of bone in the middle ear, specifically affecting the stapes bone. This abnormal bone growth leads to the fixation or immobilization of the stapes, which is responsible for transmitting sound vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear. As a result, sound waves are unable to reach the inner ear effectively, leading to a gradual decline in hearing sensitivity, particularly in the low-frequency range. In most cases, otosclerosis is a genetic condition, although other factors such as hormonal changes during pregnancy or certain autoimmune disorders may also contribute to its development.;0.021;50.0;95.0;0.224;0.029;0.168;0.796;-0.038;0.017;-0.095

This condition can affect any of the bones in the body; but most people have it in their spine, pelvis, skull, or leg bones. The disease may affect only one bone or several bones; but it does not affect the entire skeleton. Bones with Paget disease may break more easily, and the disease can lead to other health problems. The cause of Paget disease is unknown, although it may be associated with faulty genes or viral infections early in life.";Paget disease of bone, also known as osteitis deformans, is a chronic bone disorder characterized by abnormal bone remodeling, leading to weakened and deformed bones. It typically affects individuals over the age of 50 and is more prevalent in men than women. The exact cause of Paget disease is unknown, but it is thought to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Symptoms may include bone pain, deformity, fractures, hearing loss, and arthritis. Treatment options vary depending on the severity of the disease and may include medication, surgery, and physical therapy.

407;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease inherited ?;The pattern of inheritance varies with the type of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. CMT1, most cases of CMT2, and most intermediate forms are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This pattern of inheritance means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one affected parent.  CMT4, a few CMT2 subtypes, and some intermediate forms are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.  CMTX is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome. The inheritance is dominant if one copy of the altered gene is sufficient to cause the condition. In most cases, affected males, who have the alteration on their only copy of the X chromosome, experience more severe symptoms of the disorder than females, who have two X chromosomes. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons. All daughters of affected men will have one altered X chromosome, but they may only have mild symptoms of the disorder.  Some cases of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease result from a new mutation and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.;Yes, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is an inherited neurological disorder that affects the peripheral nerves, which are the nerves that connect the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body. It is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy, particularly in the hands, feet, and legs. CMT is caused by mutations in genes that are involved in the function and structure of the peripheral nerves. These mutations can be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that only one copy of the mutated gene is needed to cause the disorder, or in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning that two copies of the mutated gene are needed to cause the disorder.;0.033;221.0;96.0;0.296;0.106;0.198;0.677;0.053;-0.025;0.13
408;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) retinitis pigmentosa ?;"Retinitis pigmentosa is a group of related eye disorders that cause progressive vision loss. These disorders affect the retina, which is the layer of light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. In people with retinitis pigmentosa, vision loss occurs as the light-sensing cells of the retina gradually deteriorate.  The first sign of retinitis pigmentosa is usually a loss of night vision, which becomes apparent in childhood. Problems with night vision can make it difficult to navigate in low light. Later, the disease causes blind spots to develop in the side (peripheral) vision. Over time, these blind spots merge to produce tunnel vision. The disease progresses over years or decades to affect central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. In adulthood, many people with retinitis pigmentosa become legally blind.  The signs and symptoms of retinitis pigmentosa are most often limited to vision loss. When the disorder occurs by itself, it is described as nonsyndromic. Researchers have identified several major types of nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa, which are usually distinguished by their pattern of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked.  Less commonly, retinitis pigmentosa occurs as part of syndromes that affect other organs and tissues in the body. These forms of the disease are described as syndromic. The most common form of syndromic retinitis pigmentosa is Usher syndrome, which is characterized by the combination of vision loss and hearing loss beginning early in life. Retinitis pigmentosa is also a feature of several other genetic syndromes, including Bardet-Biedl syndrome; Refsum disease; and neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP).";Retinitis pigmentosa is a group of genetic disorders that involve a breakdown and loss of cells in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. This can cause a variety of vision problems, including night blindness, loss of peripheral vision, and difficulty seeing in dim light. Retinitis pigmentosa typically starts in childhood or early adulthood and can progress over time, leading to severe vision loss or even blindness. There is currently no cure for retinitis pigmentosa, but there are treatments that can help slow the progression of the disease and improve vision.;0.018;245.0;87.0;0.361;0.106;0.216;0.858;0.195;0.016;0.385

One potential treatment strategy involves hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which aims to replace the patient's immune cells with healthy donor cells. This approach has shown promising results in improving immune function and reducing the frequency of infections in certain patients. Additionally, gene therapy is being investigated as a potential treatment option. This approach involves introducing a functional copy of the MyD88 gene into the patient's cells, aiming to restore normal immune function. Other potential treatment avenues include the use of immunomodulatory drugs, which can help regulate the immune system and reduce inflammation.

412;gemini-pro;susceptibility;Who is at risk for Parkinson's Disease? ?;About 60,000 Americans are diagnosed with Parkinson's disease each year. The disease strikes about 50 percent more men than women. The average age of onset is 60 years, and the risk of developing the disease increases with age. Parkinson's disease is also more common in developed countries, possibly because of increased exposure to pesticides or other environmental toxins.;Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement, balance, and coordination. While the exact cause is unknown, certain factors can increase the risk of developing the condition. Age is a significant factor, with most cases occurring in individuals over 60. Genetics also play a role, with certain gene mutations linked to an increased risk. Exposure to certain environmental toxins, such as pesticides and herbicides, may also contribute to the development of Parkinson's. Additionally, individuals with a history of head injuries or concussions may be at higher risk. Finally, some medical conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, have been associated with an increased likelihood of developing Parkinson's disease.;0.037;54.0;100.0;0.325;0.081;0.239;0.666;0.092;0.105;0.076
413;gemini-pro;exams and tests;How to diagnose Marfan Syndrome ?;"Your doctor will diagnose Marfan syndrome based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results. He or she also will consult a set of guidelines called Ghent criteria, which are used to diagnose Marfan syndrome.
                
Marfan syndrome can be hard to diagnose. This is because its signs, or traits, are the same as or similar to the signs of other connective tissue disorders.
                
If you're diagnosed with Marfan syndrome, all of your first-degree relatives (for example, parents, siblings, and children) also should be checked for the disorder. This is because, even in families, the outward traits of Marfan syndrome may vary quite a bit.
                
Specialists Involved
                
Your family doctor or another type of doctor, such as an orthopedist (bone specialist), may notice certain traits that suggest Marfan syndrome.
                
If so, your doctor will likely refer you to a geneticist or cardiologist. A geneticist is hereditary disease expert. A cardiologist is a heart specialist. These two types of specialists often have the most experience working with people who have Marfan syndrome.
                
A geneticist will ask for medical information about you and your family. He or she will examine you and perhaps other members of your family. The geneticist also will coordinate your visits with other doctors, including a cardiologist, an ophthalmologist (eye specialist), and an orthopedist.
                
After reviewing the medical findings, the geneticist will determine whether you have Marfan syndrome.
                
Medical and Family Histories
                
Your doctor will ask about your medical history and your family's medical history. For example, your doctor may ask whether:
                
You've had heart disease, eye problems, or problems with your spine. These complications are common in people who have Marfan syndrome.
                
You have shortness of breath, palpitations, or chest pain. These are common symptoms of heart or lung problems linked to Marfan syndrome.
                
Any of your family members have Marfan syndrome, have died from heart problems, or have died suddenly.
                
Physical Exam
                
During the physical exam, your doctor will look for Marfan syndrome traits. For example, he or she may check the curve of your spine and the shape of your feet. Your doctor also will listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope.
                
Diagnostic Tests
                
Your doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests to help diagnose Marfan syndrome.
                
Echocardiography
                
Echocardiography (EK-o-kar-de-OG-ra-fee), or echo, is a painless test that uses sound waves to create pictures of your heart and blood vessels.
                
This test shows the size and shape of your heart and the diameter of your aorta or other blood vessels. (The aorta is the main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood to your body.) Echo also shows how well your heart's chambers and valves are working.
                
For people who have Marfan syndrome, echo mainly is used to check the heart's valves and aorta.
                
Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Computed Tomography Scans
                
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a test that uses radio waves and magnets to create detailed pictures of your organs and tissues. Computed tomography (CT) uses an x-ray machine to take clear, detailed pictures of your organs.
                
MRI and CT scans are used to check your heart valves and aorta. These scans also are used to check for dural ectasia, a nervous system complication of Marfan syndrome.
                
Slit-Lamp Exam
                
For this test, an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) will use a microscope with a light to check your eyes. A slit-lamp exam can find out whether you have a dislocated lens, cataracts, or a detached retina.
                
Genetic Testing
                
In general, genetic testing involves blood tests to detect changes in genes. However, because many different genetic changes can cause Marfan syndrome, no single blood test can diagnose the condition.
                
Ghent Criteria
                
Because no single test can diagnose Marfan syndrome, doctors use a set of guidelines called Ghent criteria to help diagnose the condition. The Ghent criteria are divided into major criteria and minor criteria. Sometimes genetic testing is part of this evaluation.
                
Major criteria include traits that are common in people who have Marfan syndrome. Minor criteria include traits that are common in many people. Doctors use a scoring system based on the number and type of Ghent criteria present to diagnose Marfan syndrome.
                
Talk with your doctor about which traits you have and your likelihood of having Marfan syndrome.";"Marfan syndrome diagnosis involves a comprehensive evaluation that includes physical examination, medical history, imaging studies, and genetic testing:

1. **Physical Examination:**
   - Assess body proportions, checking for elongated limbs, fingers, and toes (arachnodactyly).
   - Look for skeletal abnormalities like pectus excavatum (sunken chest) or pectus carinatum (protruding chest).
   - Examine the eyes for lens dislocation or ectopia lentis.

2. **Medical History:**
   - Inquire about family history of Marfan syndrome or related conditions.
   - Ask about symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or joint pain.

3. **Imaging Studies:**
   - Echocardiography to evaluate the heart, checking for aortic root dilation or mitral valve prolapse.
   - Slit-lamp eye examination to assess lens position and integrity.
   - Skeletal X-rays to look for scoliosis, kyphosis, or other bone abnormalities.

4. **Genetic Testing:**
   - Molecular genetic testing can identify mutations in the FBN1 gene, which is responsible for Marfan syndrome in most cases.";0.001;662.0;136.0;0.25;0.038;0.149;0.781;-0.193;-0.214;-0.175

Parents of an affected individual are typically unaffected carriers, each possessing one mutated copy of the gene. When two carriers have children, there is a 25% chance that each child will inherit both mutated copies of the gene and develop the condition, a 50% chance that they will inherit one mutated copy and be an unaffected carrier, and a 25% chance that they will inherit two normal copies of the gene and be unaffected.;0.109;86.0;93.0;0.537;0.163;0.352;0.871;0.256;0.285;0.225
415;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to prekallikrein deficiency ?;Prekallikrein deficiency is caused by mutations in the KLKB1 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called prekallikrein. This protein, when converted to an active form called plasma kallikrein in the blood, is involved in the early stages of blood clotting. Plasma kallikrein plays a role in a process called the intrinsic coagulation pathway (also called the contact activation pathway). This pathway turns on (activates) proteins that are needed later in the clotting process. Blood clots protect the body after an injury by sealing off damaged blood vessels and preventing further blood loss.  The KLKB1 gene mutations that cause prekallikrein deficiency reduce or eliminate functional plasma kallikrein, which likely impairs the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Researchers suggest that this lack (deficiency) of functional plasma kallikrein protein does not generally cause any symptoms because another process called the extrinsic coagulation pathway (also known as the tissue factor pathway) can compensate for the impaired intrinsic coagulation pathway.;Prekallikrein deficiency is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by mutations in the KLKB1 gene. The KLKB1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called prekallikrein, which is involved in the body's blood clotting and inflammation processes. Mutations in the KLKB1 gene can lead to a deficiency of prekallikrein, which can result in an increased risk of bleeding, prolonged bleeding time, and impaired wound healing. Additionally, individuals with prekallikrein deficiency may have reduced levels of a protein called bradykinin, which can result in decreased blood pressure and increased susceptibility to infections.;0.099;138.0;83.0;0.348;0.173;0.319;0.8;0.245;0.138;0.355

                    - After childhood liver cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the liver or to other parts of the body.     - There are two grouping systems for childhood liver cancer.    - There are four PRETEXT and POSTTEXT groups:         - PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group I     - PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group II     - PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group III     - PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group IV        - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.    - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    After childhood liver cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the liver or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the liver, to nearby tissues or organs, or to other parts of the body is called staging. In childhood liver cancer, the PRETEXT and POSTTEXT groups are used instead of stage to plan treatment. The results of the tests and procedures done to detect, diagnose, and find out whether the cancer has spread are used to determine the PRETEXT and POSTTEXT groups.
                
                
                    There are two grouping systems for childhood liver cancer.
                    Two grouping systems are used for childhood liver cancer:         - The PRETEXT group describes the tumor before the patient has treatment.    - The POSTTEXT group describes the tumor after the patient has treatment.
                
                
                    There are four PRETEXT and POSTTEXT groups:
                    The liver is divided into 4 sections. The PRETEXT and POSTTEXT groups depend on which sections of the liver have cancer.     PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group I     In group I, the cancer is found in one section of the liver. Three sections of the liver that are next to each other do not have cancer in them.       PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group II     In group II, cancer is found in one or two sections of the liver. Two sections of the liver that are next to each other do not have cancer in them.       PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group III     In group III, one of the following is true:            -  Cancer is found in three sections of the liver and one section does not have cancer.     - Cancer is found in two sections of the liver and two sections that are not next to each other do not have cancer in them.              PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group IV     In group IV, cancer is found in all four sections of the liver.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if childhood liver cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually liver cancer cells. The disease is metastatic liver cancer, not lung cancer.";Childhood Liver Cancer is classified into four stages. Stage I: The tumor is located entirely within the liver and has not spread to any other organs. Stage II: The tumor has spread to blood vessels or other structures within the liver, but has not spread to other organs. Stage III: The tumor has spread to other organs in the abdomen, such as the stomach, intestines, or lymph nodes. Stage IV: The tumor has spread to organs outside the abdomen, such as the lungs, bones, or brain.;0.0;561.0;76.0;0.317;0.054;0.195;0.647;-0.147;-0.365;0.088

To address anemia in CKD, a multidisciplinary approach is typically taken:

1. **Medications:**
    * Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs): These medications, such as epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa, stimulate the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells.
    * Iron therapy: Iron deficiency is common in CKD and can worsen anemia. Iron supplements, either oral or intravenous, may be prescribed to replenish iron stores.

2. **Diet and Lifestyle Modifications:**
    * Maintain a balanced diet: Ensure adequate intake of protein, fruits, and vegetables to support overall health and red blood cell production.
    * Limit fluid intake: Fluid restriction may be necessary for individuals with advanced CKD to prevent fluid overload, which can exacerbate anemia.

3. **Transfusions:**
    * Blood transfusions: In cases of severe anemia or when ESAs and iron therapy are not effective, blood transfusions may be necessary to increase red blood cell count and improve oxygen delivery to tissues.

4. **Treating Underlying Causes:**
    * Manage underlying conditions that may contribute to anemia, such as inflammation, infection, or vitamin deficiencies.

5. **Regular Monitoring:**
    * Monitor hemoglobin and hematocrit levels regularly to assess the effectiveness of treatment and make any necessary adjustments.";0.007;227.0;193.0;0.243;0.006;0.134;0.669;-0.324;-0.439;-0.207

425;gemini-pro;exams and tests;How to diagnose Sarcoidosis ?;"Your doctor will diagnose sarcoidosis based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. He or she will look for granulomas (inflamed lumps) in your organs. Your doctor also will try to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms.
                
Medical History
                
Your doctor may ask you detailed questions about your medical history. For example, he or she may ask whether you:
                
Have a family history of sarcoidosis.
                
Have had any jobs that may have raised your risk for the disease.
                
Have ever been exposed to inhaled beryllium metal. (This type of metal is used to make aircrafts and weapons.)
                
Have had contact with organic dust from birds or hay.
                
Exposure to beryllium metal and organic dust can cause inflamed lumps in your lungs that look like the granulomas from sarcoidosis. However, these lumps are signs of other conditions.
                
Physical Exam
                
Your doctor will check you for signs and symptoms of sarcoidosis. Signs and symptoms may include red bumps on your skin; swollen lymph nodes; an enlarged liver, spleen, or salivary glands; or redness in your eyes. Your doctor also will check for other causes of your symptoms.
                
Your doctor may listen to your lungs and heart. Abnormal breathing or heartbeat sounds could be a sign that sarcoidosis is affecting your lungs or heart.
                
Diagnostic Tests
                
You may have tests to confirm a diagnosis and to find out how sarcoidosis is affecting you. Tests include a chest x ray, lung function tests, biopsy, and other tests to assess organ damage.
                
Chest X Ray
                
A chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart and lungs. The test may show granulomas or enlarged lymph nodes in your chest. About 95 percent of people who have sarcoidosis have abnormal chest xrays.
                
Lung Function Tests
                
Lung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. These tests can show whether sarcoidosis is affecting your lungs.
                
Biopsy
                
Your doctor may do a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis or rule out other causes of your symptoms. A biopsy involves taking a small sample of tissue from one of your affected organs.
                
Usually, doctors try to biopsy the organs that are easiest to access. Examples include the skin, tear glands, or the lymph nodes that are just under the skin.
                
If this isn't possible, your doctor may use a positron emission tomography (PET) scan to pinpoint areas for biopsy. For this test, a small amount of radioactive substance is injected into a vein, usually in your arm.
                
The substance, which releases energy, travels through the blood and collects in organs or tissues. Special cameras detect the energy and convert it into three-dimensional (3D) pictures.
                
If lung function tests or a chest x ray shows signs of sarcoidosis in your lungs, your doctor may do a bronchoscopy (bron-KOS-ko-pee) to get a small sample of lung tissue.
                
During this procedure, a thin, flexible tube is passed through your nose (or sometimes your mouth), down your throat, and into the airways to reach your lung tissue. (For more information, go to the Health Topics Bronchoscopy article.)
                
Other Tests To Assess Organ Damage
                
You also may have other tests to assess organ damage and find out whether you need treatment. For example, your doctor may recommend blood tests and/or an EKG (electrocardiogram).
                
If youre diagnosed with sarcoidosis, you should see an ophthalmologist (eye specialist), even if you dont have eye symptoms. In sarcoidosis, eye damage can occur without symptoms.";Sarcoidosis is a complex multisystem disorder characterized by the formation of granulomas, small inflammatory lesions, in various organs. A definitive diagnosis of sarcoidosis requires a combination of clinical findings, imaging studies, and biopsy results. Typically, a detailed medical history and physical examination are performed to assess symptoms and identify potential clues. Imaging techniques, such as chest X-rays or CT scans, can reveal characteristic findings in the lungs or other affected organs. A biopsy of affected tissue, often obtained through bronchoscopy or lymph node sampling, is essential for confirming the diagnosis. Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen allows pathologists to identify the presence of non-caseating granulomas, a hallmark of sarcoidosis. Additional tests, including blood tests, lung function tests, and cardiac evaluations, may be conducted to assess the extent and severity of the disease and rule out other conditions with similar symptoms.;0.002;568.0;127.0;0.273;0.055;0.174;0.709;-0.035;-0.134;0.064
426;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Retinal Disorders ?;The retina is a layer of tissue in the back of your eye that senses light and sends images to your brain. In the center of this nerve tissue is the macula. It provides the sharp, central vision needed for reading, driving and seeing fine detail.    Retinal disorders affect this vital tissue. They can affect your vision, and some can be serious enough to cause blindness. Examples are       - Macular degeneration - a disease that destroys your sharp, central vision    - Diabetic eye disease    - Retinal detachment - a medical emergency, when the retina is pulled away from the back of the eye    - Retinoblastoma - cancer of the retina. It is most common in young children.    - Macular pucker - scar tissue on the macula    - Macular hole - a small break in the macula that usually happens to people over 60    - Floaters - cobwebs or specks in your field of vision       NIH: National Eye Institute;Retinal disorders are a group of conditions that affect the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. These disorders can cause a range of symptoms, including blurred vision, floaters, flashes of light, and vision loss. Some common retinal disorders include macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, retinal detachment, retinitis pigmentosa, and uveitis. Treatment for retinal disorders depends on the specific condition and may include medication, laser therapy, surgery, or a combination of treatments.

427;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to GLUT1 deficiency syndrome ?;"GLUT1 deficiency syndrome is caused by mutations in the SLC2A1 gene. This gene provides instructions for producing a protein called the glucose transporter protein type 1 (GLUT1). The GLUT1 protein is embedded in the outer membrane surrounding cells, where it transports a simple sugar called glucose into cells from the blood or from other cells for use as fuel.  In the brain, the GLUT1 protein is involved in moving glucose, which is the brain's main energy source, across the blood-brain barrier. The blood-brain barrier acts as a boundary between tiny blood vessels (capillaries) and the surrounding brain tissue; it protects the brain's delicate nerve tissue by preventing many other types of molecules from entering the brain. The GLUT1 protein also moves glucose between cells in the brain called glia, which protect and maintain nerve cells (neurons).  SLC2A1 gene mutations reduce or eliminate the function of the GLUT1 protein. Having less functional GLUT1 protein reduces the amount of glucose available to brain cells, which affects brain development and function.";GLUT1 deficiency syndrome, also known as glucose transporter type 1 deficiency, is caused by genetic changes in the SLC2A1 gene, which encodes the facilitative glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) protein responsible for transporting glucose across the blood-brain barrier and into various other cells. These genetic alterations can include point mutations, insertions, deletions, or rearrangements, resulting in impaired function or complete loss of the GLUT1 protein. Some common mutations associated with GLUT1 deficiency syndrome include missense mutations that alter the amino acid sequence of the protein, leading to reduced glucose transport activity, and nonsense mutations that result in truncated or non-functional GLUT1 proteins. Other mutations can affect the regulatory elements of the SLC2A1 gene, influencing the expression levels or stability of the GLUT1 protein. These genetic changes lead to impaired glucose metabolism, particularly in the brain and red blood cells, causing the clinical manifestations and neurological symptoms observed in individuals with GLUT1 deficiency syndrome.;0.049;147.0;140.0;0.368;0.115;0.276;0.869;0.182;0.177;0.183
428;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ?;Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a disorder in which the immune system produces too many activated immune cells (lymphocytes) called T cells, natural killer cells, B cells, and macrophages (histiocytes). Excessive amounts of immune system proteins called cytokines are also produced. This overactivation of the immune system causes fever and damages the liver and spleen, resulting in enlargement of these organs.  Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis also destroys blood-producing cells in the bone marrow, a process called hemophagocytosis. As a result, affected individuals have low numbers of red blood cells (anemia) and a reduction in the number of blood cells involved in clotting (platelets). A reduction in platelets may cause easy bruising and abnormal bleeding.  The brain may also be affected in familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. As a result, affected individuals may experience irritability, delayed closure of the bones of the skull in infants, neck stiffness, abnormal muscle tone, impaired muscle coordination, paralysis, blindness, seizures, and coma. In addition to neurological problems, familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis can cause abnormalities of the heart, kidneys, and other organs and tissues. Affected individuals also have an increased risk of developing cancers of blood-forming cells (leukemia and lymphoma).  Signs and symptoms of familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis usually become apparent during infancy, although occasionally they appear later in life. They usually occur when the immune system launches an exaggerated response to an infection, but may also occur in the absence of infection. Without treatment, most people with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis survive only a few months.;Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) is a rare, life-threatening genetic disorder characterized by an overactive immune response that leads to the destruction of healthy cells and tissues. It is caused by mutations in genes involved in the regulation of immune function, resulting in the accumulation of activated immune cells called histiocytes and lymphocytes in various organs, particularly the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. This accumulation leads to tissue damage, organ dysfunction, and a range of clinical manifestations, including fever, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, and central nervous system involvement. FHL can occur in both children and adults and is often associated with other genetic conditions such as Chediak-Higashi syndrome and Griscelli syndrome. Treatment typically involves immunosuppressive therapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or a combination of both. Early diagnosis and prompt intervention are crucial for improving outcomes and preventing life-threatening complications.;0.019;223.0;130.0;0.291;0.067;0.128;0.705;-0.031;-0.005;-0.06

The primary treatment involves phosphate and active vitamin D (calcitriol) supplementation. Oral phosphate is given in divided doses throughout the day to maintain serum phosphate levels within the normal range. Calcitriol is administered daily or weekly to increase intestinal phosphate absorption and promote calcium and phosphate deposition in the bones. Additional treatments may include calcium supplements, proper hydration, a balanced diet, and regular exercise to support bone health. In severe cases, surgical interventions such as corrective osteotomies or spinal fusion may be considered to address skeletal deformities.

- Teach your child not to hold in urine and to go to the bathroom whenever your child feels the urge.  - Teach your child how to properly clean himself or herself after using the bathroom to keep bacteria from entering the urinary tract.  - Have your child wear loose-fitting clothes. Tight clothes can trap moisture, which allows bacteria to grow.  - Buy your child cotton underwear. Cotton lets in air to dry the area.  - If your child has constipation, talk with a health care provider about the best treatment options.";Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in children, especially girls. Symptoms can include cloudy or foul-smelling urine, frequent urination, urgency to urinate, pain or burning during urination. Here are some tips to prevent UTIs in your child: Encourage your child to drink plenty of fluids, especially water. This helps to flush out bacteria from the bladder. Have your child urinate frequently, especially after activities that involve sitting or holding in urine for long periods of time. Help your child practice good hygiene by washing their hands before eating and after using the bathroom. Avoid using harsh soaps or douches, which can irritate the urethra and make it more susceptible to infection.

Childhood vaccines for measles and whooping cough prevent infections related to these illnesses. These vaccines also reduce complications from these infections, such as bronchiectasis.
                
Avoiding toxic fumes, gases, smoke, and other harmful substances also can help protect your lungs.
                
Proper treatment of lung infections in children also may help preserve lung function and prevent lung damage that can lead to bronchiectasis.
                
Stay alert to keep children (and adults) from inhaling small objects (such as pieces of toys and food that might stick in a small airway). If you think you, your child, or someone else has inhaled a small object, seek prompt medical care.
                
In some cases, treating the underlying cause of bronchiectasis can slow or prevent its progression.";Prevention of bronchiectasis primarily involves addressing underlying conditions that can lead to the development of the disease. These include: 1. Maintaining proper hygiene: Regularly washing hands, covering coughs and sneezes, and avoiding contact with individuals with respiratory infections can help prevent the spread of infectious agents that can cause bronchiectasis. 2. Vaccination: Vaccinations against respiratory pathogens, such as measles, whooping cough, and influenza, can help protect against infections that can contribute to the development of bronchiectasis. 3. Managing underlying conditions: Properly managing conditions like cystic fibrosis, asthma, and immune deficiencies can help prevent or slow the progression of bronchiectasis. 4. Smoking cessation: Smoking is a major risk factor for bronchiectasis. Quitting smoking can significantly reduce the risk of developing the condition. 5. Early diagnosis and treatment of respiratory infections: Prompt diagnosis and treatment of respiratory infections can help prevent the development of chronic infections and subsequent bronchiectasis.;0.051;132.0;138.0;0.337;0.091;0.181;0.785;0.175;0.153;0.194

Additional tests may include a skin biopsy and thermography to evaluate skin temperature. Blood tests or other studies may be done to rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. There is not a specific type of doctor that always diagnoses and treats erythromelalgia. A variety of specialists (alone or in combination) may be involved in the diagnosis and treatment of this condition. These may include vascular specialists, hematologists, dermatologists, neurologists, rheumatologists, and other types of physicians. The type of specialist that is appropriate may depend on the underlying cause when secondary erythromelalgia is present. Since erythromelalgia is a rare disease, many doctors are not familiar with the condition. The Erythromelalgia Association offers resources and support for individuals looking for more information about the diagnosis of the condition.;Erythromelalgia is a rare disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of burning pain, redness, and warmth in the extremities, typically the hands and feet. Diagnosis involves a combination of clinical evaluation, medical history, and specialized tests. During a clinical examination, the doctor assesses the affected areas for signs of inflammation, swelling, and temperature changes. A detailed medical history helps identify potential underlying causes, such as medications, medical conditions, or lifestyle factors. Additionally, specific tests like blood tests, nerve conduction studies, and skin biopsies may be recommended to rule out other conditions and confirm the diagnosis of erythromelalgia.;0.052;132.0;87.0;0.357;0.094;0.217;0.779;0.135;0.113;0.156

434;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) CHILD syndrome ?;CHILD syndrome, also known as congenital hemidysplasia with ichthyosiform erythroderma and limb defects, is a genetic condition that is typically characterized by large patches of skin that are red and inflamed (erythroderma) and covered with flaky scales (ichthyosis) and limb underdevelopment or absence. The development of organs such as the brain, heart, lungs, and kidneys may also be affected. Several cases in which milder signs and symptoms have been reported in the medical literature. The condition is caused by mutations in the NSDHL gene, a gene that provides instructions for the production of an enzyme involved in the making of cholesterol. CHILD syndrome is inherited in an X-linked dominant fashion and is almost exclusively found in females.;CHILD syndrome is a rare, life-threatening condition that primarily affects young children. It is characterized by a combination of chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, hepatic (liver) dysfunction, immunodeficiency, lymphoedema (swelling of body tissues due to fluid accumulation), and developmental delay. The exact cause of CHILD syndrome is unknown, but it is believed to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Symptoms of CHILD syndrome can vary, but commonly include abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, failure to thrive, swelling of the hands and feet, recurrent infections, and developmental delays. Treatment for CHILD syndrome typically involves supportive care and management of the various symptoms. Bone marrow transplantation may be considered in some cases.

435;gemini-pro;exams and tests;How to diagnose Nephrotic Syndrome in Adults ?;"Urine samples are taken to diagnose people suspected of having nephrotic syndrome.
                
Nephrotic syndrome is diagnosed when large amounts of protein are found in the urine. The blood protein albumin makes up much of the protein that is lost, though many other important proteins are also lost in nephrotic syndrome.
                
The presence of albumin in the urine can be detected with a dipstick test performed on a urine sample. The urine sample is collected in a special container in a health care providers office or commercial facility and can be tested in the same location or sent to a lab for analysis. For the test, a nurse or technician places a strip of chemically treated paper, called a dipstick, into the urine. Patches on the dipstick change color when protein is present in urine.
                
A more precise measurement is usually needed to confirm the diagnosis. Either a single urine sample or a 24-hour collection of urine can be sent to a lab for analysis. With the single urine sample, the lab measures both albumin and creatinine, a waste product of normal muscle breakdown. The comparison of the measurements is called a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. A urine sample containing more than 30 milligrams of albumin for each gram of creatinine may signal a problem. With a 24-hour collection of urine, the lab measures only the amount of albumin present. The single urine sample is easier to collect than the 24-hour sample and is usually sufficient to confirm diagnosis, though the 24-hour collection may be used in some cases.
                
Once nephrotic syndrome is diagnosed, blood tests are usually needed to check for systemic diseases that may be causing the nephrotic syndrome and to find out how well the kidneys are working overall. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis.
                
Though blood tests can point toward systemic diseases, a kidney biopsy is usually needed to diagnose the specific underlying disease causing the nephrotic syndrome and to determine the best treatment. A kidney biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of kidney tissue for examination with a microscope. Kidney biopsies are performed by a health care provider in a hospital with light sedation and local anesthetic. A biopsy is often not needed for a person with diabetes because the persons medical history and lab tests may be enough to diagnose the problem as being a result of diabetes.";"In adults, diagnosing nephrotic syndrome involves a thorough assessment of symptoms, medical history, and laboratory testing. Key steps in the diagnostic process include:

1. **History and Physical Examination:** Detailed medical history should inquire about edema, proteinuria, hematuria, and other relevant symptoms. Physical examination focuses on assessing edema, blood pressure, and signs of underlying systemic diseases.

2. **Urinalysis:** Urinalysis is essential. Proteinuria is a hallmark finding, with protein levels typically exceeding 3.5 grams per day. Microscopic examination may reveal red blood cells, casts, or other abnormalities.

3. **Serum Protein and Albumin:** Serum protein and albumin levels are measured. Low serum protein (<6 grams per deciliter) and albumin (<3 grams per deciliter) are characteristic findings.

4. **Lipid Profile:** Lipid profile is often abnormal in nephrotic syndrome, with elevated total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglycerides.

5. **Kidney Function Tests:** Serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are assessed to evaluate kidney function.

6. **Renal Biopsy:** In selected cases, a kidney biopsy may be performed to determine the underlying cause of the nephrotic syndrome and guide treatment. This is typically considered if the cause of the syndrome is unclear or if there is suspicion of a specific underlying disease.";0.015;355.0;188.0;0.246;0.056;0.113;0.729;-0.037;-0.071;-0.006
436;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Prosopagnosia ?;"Prosopagnosia is a neurological disorder characterized by the inability to recognize faces. Prosopagnosia is also known as face blindness or facial agnosia. The term prosopagnosia comes from the Greek words for face and lack of knowledge. Depending upon the degree of impairment, some people with prosopagnosia may only have difficulty recognizing a familiar face; others will be unable to discriminate between unknown faces, while still others may not even be able to distinguish a face as being different from an object. Some people with the disorder are unable to recognize their own face. Prosopagnosia is not related to memory dysfunction, memory loss, impaired vision, or learning disabilities. Prosopagnosia is thought to be the result of abnormalities, damage, or impairment in the right fusiform gyrus, a fold in the brain that appears to coordinate the neural systems that control facial perception and memory. Prosopagnosia can result from stroke, traumatic brain injury, or certain neurodegenerative diseases. In some cases it is a congenital disorder, present at birth in the absence of any brain damage. Congenital prosopagnosia appears to run in families, which makes it likely to be the result of a genetic mutation or deletion. Some degree of prosopagnosia is often present in children with autism and Aspergers syndrome, and may be the cause of their impaired social development.";Prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness, is a neurological condition in which an individual loses the ability to recognize faces. This condition can be caused by damage to the fusiform face area (FFA) of the brain, which is responsible for processing facial information. Prosopagnosia can be congenital (present from birth) or acquired through brain injury. Symptoms of prosopagnosia can vary, from an inability to recognize faces completely to difficulty recognizing familiar faces or even one's own face. Treatment for prosopagnosia is limited, as there is no cure for the condition. However, individuals with prosopagnosia can learn to compensate for their condition by using other cues, such as voice, body movements, and context, to identify people.;0.048;198.0;108.0;0.402;0.112;0.212;0.885;0.271;0.189;0.352

Some forms of MD are seen in infancy or childhood, while others may not appear until middle age or later. The disorders differ in terms of the distribution and extent of muscle weakness (some forms of MD also affect cardiac muscle), age of onset, rate of progression, and pattern of inheritance. Duchenne MD is the most common form of MD and primarily affects boys. It is caused by the absence of dystrophin, a protein involved in maintaining the integrity of muscle. Onset is between 3 and 5 years and the disorder progresses rapidly. Most boys are unable to walk by age 12, and later need a respirator to breathe. Girls in these families have a 50 percent chance of inheriting and passing the defective gene to their children. Boys with Becker MD (very similar to but less severe than Duchenne MD) have faulty or not enough dystrophin. Facioscapulohumeral MD usually begins in the teenage years. It causes progressive weakness in muscles of the face, arms, legs, and around the shoulders and chest. It progresses slowly and can vary in symptoms from mild to disabling. Myotonic MD is the disorder's most common adult form and is typified by prolonged muscle spasms, cataracts, cardiac abnormalities, and endocrine disturbances. Individuals with myotonic MD have long, thin faces, drooping eyelids, and a swan-like neck.;Muscular dystrophy is a group of genetic muscle diseases that cause progressive muscle weakness and degeneration. Muscular dystrophies are caused by mutations in genes that encode proteins essential for muscle function. These mutations can lead to the production of defective proteins or a complete lack of these proteins. The absence or dysfunction of these proteins disrupts the structure and function of muscle fibers, leading to muscle weakness and degeneration.;0.004;228.0;64.0;0.256;0.051;0.2;0.675;0.018;-0.208;0.263

Myofibrillar myopathy primarily affects skeletal muscles, which are muscles that the body uses for movement. In some cases, the heart (cardiac) muscle is also affected.  The signs and symptoms of myofibrillar myopathy vary widely among affected individuals, typically depending on the condition's genetic cause. Most people with this disorder begin to develop muscle weakness (myopathy) in mid-adulthood. However, features of this condition can appear anytime between infancy and late adulthood. Muscle weakness most often begins in the hands and feet (distal muscles), but some people first experience weakness in the muscles near the center of the body (proximal muscles). Other affected individuals develop muscle weakness throughout their body. Facial muscle weakness can cause swallowing and speech difficulties. Muscle weakness worsens over time.  Other signs and symptoms of myofibrillar myopathy can include a weakened heart muscle (cardiomyopathy), muscle pain (myalgia), loss of sensation and weakness in the limbs (peripheral neuropathy), and respiratory failure. Individuals with this condition may have skeletal problems including joint stiffness (contractures) and abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Rarely, people with this condition develop clouding of the lens of the eyes (cataracts).;Myofibrillar myopathy is a group of inherited muscle diseases that affect the structure and function of the myofibrils, the contractile units within muscle cells.

This means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. Affected people inherit one mutated copy of the gene from each parent, who is referred to as a carrier. Carriers of an autosomal recessive condition typically do not have any signs or symptoms (they are unaffected). When 2 carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a: 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected 50% (1 in 2) chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier;Galloway-Mowat syndrome is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that only one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In some cases, however, the condition can be caused by a new mutation (de novo mutation) in the affected individual, meaning that they do not inherit the mutation from either parent. It is believed that these cases may occur due to advanced parental age or other factors that can increase the risk of genetic mutations.;0.056;106.0;76.0;0.439;0.133;0.293;0.88;0.104;0.045;0.162

447;gemini-pro;outlook;What is the outlook for Salivary Gland Cancer ?;Certain factors affect treatment options and prognosis (chance of recovery). The treatment options and prognosis (chance of recovery) depend on the following:         - The stage of the cancer (especially the size of the tumor).    - The type of salivary gland the cancer is in.    - The type of cancer cells (how they look under a microscope).    - The patient's age and general health.;The outlook for salivary gland cancer depends on several factors, including the stage of the cancer, the type of cancer, and the patient's overall health. With early-stage cancers, the five-year survival rate is typically high, often exceeding 90%. However, the survival rate decreases with more advanced stages and is generally lower for high-grade cancers. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Advanced salivary gland cancers may not be curable, but treatment can help control the cancer and improve the patient's quality of life. Regular follow-up care is essential to monitor for recurrence and manage any long-term side effects of treatment.;0.042;48.0;95.0;0.275;0.093;0.157;0.727;0.085;0.145;0.024

If the cancer starts inside the eyeball it's called intraocular cancer. The most common intraocular cancers in adults are melanoma and lymphoma. The most common eye cancer in children is retinoblastoma, which starts in the cells of the retina. Cancer can also spread to the eye from other parts of the body.    Treatment for eye cancer varies by the type and by how advanced it is. It may include surgery, radiation therapy, freezing or heat therapy, or laser therapy.;Eye cancer, also known as ocular cancer or intraocular cancer, refers to the development of malignant tumors within the eye or its associated structures. These tumors can arise from various parts of the eye, including the retina, choroid, conjunctiva, and lacrimal gland. The most common types of eye cancer are melanoma, retinoblastoma, choroidal melanoma, and conjunctival carcinoma. Eye cancers can affect individuals of all ages, but certain types are more prevalent in specific age groups or have genetic predispositions. Early detection and appropriate treatment are crucial for managing eye cancer and preserving vision.;0.041;94.0;88.0;0.381;0.092;0.19;0.772;0.152;0.202;0.099

450;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to autosomal dominant hypocalcemia ?;"Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia is primarily caused by mutations in the CASR gene; these cases are known as type 1. A small percentage of cases, known as type 2, are caused by mutations in the GNA11 gene. The proteins produced from these genes work together to regulate the amount of calcium in the blood.  The CASR gene provides instructions for making a protein called the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). Calcium molecules attach (bind) to the CaSR protein, which allows this protein to monitor and regulate the amount of calcium in the blood. G11, which is produced from the GNA11 gene, is one component of a signaling protein that works in conjunction with CaSR. When a certain concentration of calcium is reached, CaSR stimulates G11 to send signals to block processes that increase the amount of calcium in the blood.  Mutations in the CASR or GNA11 gene lead to overactivity of the respective protein. The altered CaSR protein is more sensitive to calcium, meaning even low levels of calcium can trigger it to stimulate G11 signaling. Similarly, the altered G11 protein continues to send signals to prevent calcium increases, even when levels in the blood are very low. As a result, calcium levels in the blood remain low, causing hypocalcemia. Calcium plays an important role in the control of muscle movement, and a shortage of this molecule can lead to cramping or twitching of the muscles. Impairment of the processes that increase calcium can also disrupt the normal regulation of other molecules, such as phosphate and magnesium, leading to other signs of autosomal dominant hypocalcemia. Studies show that the lower the amount of calcium in the blood, the more severe the symptoms of the condition are.";Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (ADH) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by low levels of calcium in the blood. It is caused by mutations in the CASR gene, which encodes the calcium-sensing receptor. This receptor is located on the surface of cells in the parathyroid glands, kidneys, and bones, and it plays a key role in regulating calcium homeostasis. Mutations in the CASR gene lead to a decrease in the sensitivity of the receptor to calcium, which results in an increase in the production of parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH is a hormone that increases calcium levels in the blood by stimulating the release of calcium from bones and increasing the absorption of calcium from the intestines. The increased PTH levels in ADH can lead to a variety of symptoms, including muscle weakness, bone pain, and kidney stones.;0.057;247.0;116.0;0.342;0.128;0.246;0.687;0.132;0.086;0.176

453;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to Norrie disease ?;Mutations in the NDP gene cause Norrie disease.  The NDP gene provides instructions for making a protein called norrin. Norrin participates in the Wnt cascade, a sequence of steps that affect the way cells and tissues develop. In particular, norrin seems to play a critical role in the specialization of retinal cells for their unique sensory capabilities. It is also involved in the establishment of a blood supply to tissues of the retina and the inner ear, and the development of other body systems.  In order to initiate the Wnt cascade, norrin must bind (attach) to another protein called frizzled-4. Mutations in the norrin protein interfere with its ability to bind to frizzled-4, resulting in the signs and symptoms of Norrie disease.;Norrie disease is a rare X-linked genetic disorder primarily affecting males and is caused by mutations in the NDP gene. The NDP gene encodes a protein called Norrin, which plays a crucial role in the development of retinal blood vessels. Mutations in this gene disrupt the normal production or function of Norrin, leading to abnormal development and degeneration of blood vessels in the retina. These changes result in progressive vision impairment and can eventually lead to blindness. The genetic alterations associated with Norrie disease primarily involve pathogenic variants within the NDP gene, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splicing mutations. These mutations impair the structure, stability, or function of the Norrin protein, ultimately leading to the characteristic retinal abnormalities observed in individuals with Norrie disease.;0.058;106.0;111.0;0.275;0.111;0.203;0.817;0.15;0.151;0.145

458;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) cap myopathy ?;Cap myopathy is a disorder that primarily affects skeletal muscles, which are muscles that the body uses for movement. People with cap myopathy have muscle weakness (myopathy) and poor muscle tone (hypotonia) throughout the body, but they are most severely affected in the muscles of the face, neck, and limbs. The muscle weakness, which begins at birth or during childhood, can worsen over time.  Affected individuals may have feeding and swallowing difficulties in infancy. They typically have delayed development of motor skills such as sitting, crawling, standing, and walking. They may fall frequently, tire easily, and have difficulty running, climbing stairs, or jumping. In some cases, the muscles used for breathing are affected, and life-threatening breathing difficulties can occur.  People with cap myopathy may have a high arch in the roof of the mouth (high-arched palate), severely drooping eyelids (ptosis), and a long face. Some affected individuals develop an abnormally curved lower back (lordosis) or a spine that curves to the side (scoliosis).  The name cap myopathy comes from characteristic abnormal cap-like structures that can be seen in muscle cells when muscle tissue is viewed under a microscope. The severity of cap myopathy is related to the percentage of muscle cells that have these caps. Individuals in whom 70 to 75 percent of muscle cells have caps typically have severe breathing problems and may not survive childhood, while those in whom 10 to 30 percent of muscle cells have caps have milder symptoms and can live into adulthood.;Cap myopathy, also known as muscle weakness disorder, is a group of disorders that affect the muscles. It is characterized by muscle weakness, pain, and stiffness. Cap myopathy can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetic defects, autoimmune disorders, infections, and certain medications. Symptoms of cap myopathy can include muscle weakness, pain, and stiffness, as well as difficulty breathing, swallowing, and walking. Diagnosis of cap myopathy typically involves a physical exam, blood tests, imaging tests, and muscle biopsies.

459;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency inherited ?;"How is dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency inherited? Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that in affected individuals, both copies of the DPYD gene in each cell (one inherited from each parent) have mutations. The mutations that cause DPD deficiency vary widely in severity; therefore, some people with 2 mutated copies of the gene may have signs and symptoms of the condition, while others may be asymptomatic. However, all individuals with 2 mutations are at risk for toxic reactions to fluoropyrimidine drugs. Individuals who carry one mutated copy of the disease-causing gene (including most parents of affected individuals) are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not have signs and symptoms of the condition. However, people with one mutated copy of the DPYD gene may still experience toxic reactions to fluoropyrimidine drugs. When 2 carriers for the same autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each parent, and a 25% risk to not have the condition and not be a carrier. A child of one carrier parent has a 50% risk to also be a carrier.";Yes, Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency is primarily inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning that both copies of the gene encoding the enzyme must carry mutations in order for the deficiency to manifest. In this type of inheritance, both parents carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they are unaffected (carriers). When both parents are carriers, there is a 25% chance with each pregnancy that their child will inherit two copies of the mutated gene and have DPD deficiency.;0.038;184.0;73.0;0.478;0.119;0.391;0.834;0.166;0.034;0.302

464;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to familial hypobetalipoproteinemia ?;Most cases of FHBL are caused by mutations in the APOB gene. This gene provides instructions for making two versions of the apolipoprotein B protein: a short version called apolipoprotein B-48 and a longer version known as apolipoprotein B-100. Both of these proteins are components of lipoproteins, which transport fats and cholesterol in the blood.  Most APOB gene mutations that lead to FHBL cause both versions of apolipoprotein B to be abnormally short. The severity of the condition largely depends on the length of these two versions of apolipoprotein B. Severely shortened versions cannot partner with lipoproteins and transport fats and cholesterol. Proteins that are only slightly shortened retain some function but partner less effectively with lipoproteins. Generally, the signs and symptoms of FHBL are worse if both versions of apolipoprotein B are severely shortened. Mild or no signs and symptoms result when the proteins are only slightly shortened. All of these protein changes lead to a reduction of functional apolipoprotein B. As a result, the transportation of dietary fats and cholesterol is decreased or absent. A decrease in fat transport reduces the body's ability to absorb fats and fat-soluble vitamins from the diet.  Although APOB gene mutations are responsible for most cases of FHBL, mutations in a few other genes account for a small number of cases. Some people with FHBL do not have identified mutations in any of these genes. Changes in other, unidentified genes are likely involved in this condition.;Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL) is a rare inherited disorder characterized by low levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood. This is caused by mutations in genes involved in the production or regulation of apolipoprotein B (apoB), a protein essential for the assembly and secretion of LDL particles. Some common genetic changes associated with FHBL include mutations in the APOB gene, which encodes apoB, and mutations in the PCSK9 gene, which encodes proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a protein involved in the regulation of LDL cholesterol levels. These mutations can lead to decreased production or impaired function of apoB or PCSK9, resulting in reduced LDL cholesterol levels and an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease.;0.03;225.0;106.0;0.328;0.086;0.203;0.77;-0.004;-0.017;0.006
465;gemini-pro;susceptibility;what is the risk for my pet for Rabies ?;"Any animal bitten or scratched by either a wild, carnivorous mammal or a bat that is not available for testing should be regarded as having been exposed to rabies.
  
Unvaccinated dogs, cats, and ferrets exposed to a rabid animal should be euthanized immediately. If the owner is unwilling to have this done, the animal should be placed in strict isolation for 6 months and vaccinated 1 month before being released.
  
Animals with expired vaccinations need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Dogs and cats that are currently vaccinated are kept under observation for 45 days.
  
Small mammals such as squirrels, rats, mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, gerbils, chipmunks, rabbits, and hares are almost never found to be infected with rabies and have not been known to cause rabies among humans in the United States. Bites by these animals are usually not considered a risk of rabies unless the animal was sick or behaving in any unusual manner and rabies is widespread in your area.
  
However, from 1985 through 1994, woodchucks accounted for 86% of the 368 cases of rabies among rodents reported to CDC. Woodchucks or groundhogs (Marmota monax) are the only rodents that may be frequently submitted to state health department because of a suspicion of rabies. In all cases involving rodents, the state or local health department should be consulted before a decision is made to initiate postexposure prophylaxis (PEP).
  Is there rabies in my area?
  
Each state collects specific information about rabies, and is the best source for information on rabies in your area. In addition, the CDC publishes rabies surveillance data every year for the United States. The report, entitled Rabies Surveillance in the United States, contains information about the number of cases of rabies reported to CDC during the year, the animals reported rabid, maps showing where cases were reported for wild and domestic animals, and distribution maps showing outbreaks of rabies associated with specific animals.";The risk of rabies for your pet depends on several factors, including their lifestyle, location, and vaccination status. Pets that spend a lot of time outdoors, particularly in rural or wooded areas, are at higher risk of encountering wild animals that may carry rabies. Unvaccinated pets are also at greater risk, as they lack the protection of antibodies that can help fight off the virus. Additionally, pets that have been bitten or scratched by an animal suspected of having rabies are at high risk and should receive immediate medical attention.

Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (S. maltophilia) infections are caused by the S. maltophilia bacteria. These bacteria live in various aquatic (water-based) environments. In a hospital setting, they are able to survive and multiply in fluids such as respiratory secretions, urine, and intravenous (IV) fluids. Most healthy people do not get S. maltophilia infections. However, people who are hospitalized and receiving treatment for other conditions may be susceptible to these infections, especially those with severely impaired immune systems. Factors that increase the risk for S. maltophilia infection include admission to an intensive care unit, prolonged hospitalization, HIV infection, cancer, cystic fibrosis, neutropenia, recent surgery, trauma, mechanical ventilation, and previous therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics (medications that target a wide range of bacteria).;Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infection occurs due to exposure to contaminated water, soil, medical devices, or surfaces harboring the bacteria. Infection can occur in immunocompromised individuals, those receiving long-term treatment with antibiotics, or have chronic illnesses. Transmission can be through direct contact with contaminated sources or inhalation of contaminated respiratory droplets. Its multidrug resistance makes treatment challenging, requiring careful selection of effective antibiotics or a combination of antibiotics and surgical intervention in severe cases.;0.015;118.0;70.0;0.21;0.022;0.14;0.828;-0.021;-0.055;0.01
467;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Lung Cancer ?;Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. It is a leading cause of cancer death in men and women in the United States. Cigarette smoking causes most lung cancers. The more cigarettes you smoke per day and the earlier you started smoking, the greater your risk of lung cancer. High levels of pollution, radiation and asbestos exposure may also increase risk.     Common symptoms of lung cancer include       - A cough that doesn't go away and gets worse over time    - Constant chest pain    - Coughing up blood    - Shortness of breath, wheezing, or hoarseness    - Repeated problems with pneumonia or bronchitis    - Swelling of the neck and face    - Loss of appetite or weight loss    - Fatigue       Doctors diagnose lung cancer using a physical exam, imaging, and lab tests. Treatment depends on the type, stage, and how advanced it is. Treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.    NIH: National Cancer Institute;Lung cancer is a malignant lung tumor characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the lung. This uncontrolled growth can lead to the formation of cancerous tumors that can obstruct airways and spread to other parts of the body. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and is primarily caused by tobacco smoking, which accounts for approximately 80-90% of cases. Other risk factors include exposure to secondhand smoke, radon gas, asbestos, and certain occupational carcinogens. Symptoms of lung cancer often include a persistent cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, unintended weight loss, and coughing up blood or rust-colored sputum. Early detection and prompt treatment are crucial for improving the chances of survival.;0.065;151.0;110.0;0.309;0.104;0.17;0.779;0.075;0.044;0.102
468;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome ?;8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome is a blood cancer that involves different types of blood cells. Blood cells are divided into several groups (lineages) based on the type of early cell from which they are descended. Two of these lineages are myeloid cells and lymphoid cells. Individuals with 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome can develop both myeloid cell cancer and lymphoid cell cancer.  The condition can occur at any age. It usually begins as a myeloproliferative disorder, which is characterized by a high number of white blood cells (leukocytes). Most affected individuals also have an excess of myeloid cells known as eosinophils (eosinophilia).  In addition to a myeloproliferative disorder, many people with 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome develop lymphoma, which is a form of blood cancer that involves lymphoid cells. The cancerous lymphoid cells grow and divide in lymph nodes, forming a tumor that enlarges the lymph nodes. In most cases of 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome, the cancerous cells are lymphoid cells called T cells. Lymphoma can develop at the same time as the myeloproliferative disorder or later.  In most people with 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome, the myeloproliferative disorder develops into a fast-growing blood cancer called acute myeloid leukemia.  The rapid myeloid and lymphoid cell production caused by these cancers results in enlargement of the spleen and liver (splenomegaly and hepatomegaly, respectively). Most people with 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome have symptoms such as fatigue or night sweats. Some affected individuals have no symptoms, and the condition is discovered through routine blood tests.;8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused by an abnormality on chromosome 8, specifically the deletion of a small region called 8p11. This deletion results in the overexpression of several genes in the region, including FGFR1, which is involved in cell growth and proliferation. This overexpression leads to the development of myeloproliferative neoplasms, a group of blood cancers characterized by an overproduction of blood cells such as red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The syndrome is typically diagnosed in children and young adults and can manifest with various symptoms including fatigue, weakness, splenomegaly (enlarged spleen), anemia, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and leukocytosis (high white blood cell count). Treatment typically involves a combination of chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and stem cell transplantation.;0.026;224.0;113.0;0.342;0.083;0.182;0.713;0.025;0.017;0.031

                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.

Don't Ignore Symptoms You should see your doctor about any symptoms like these. Most often, they are not cancer, but it's important to check with the doctor so that any problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible. Some women believe that as they age, health problems are due to ""growing older."" Because of this myth, many illnesses go undiagnosed and untreated. Don't ignore your symptoms because you think they are not important or because you believe they are normal for your age. Talk to your doctor.";Breast cancer typically presents with a painless lump in the breast, often discovered during self-examination or mammography. Other symptoms may include changes in breast shape or size, dimpling or puckering of the skin, nipple changes such as inversion or discharge, breast or nipple pain, redness or thickening of the skin, and swollen lymph nodes in the armpit or collarbone area. Some people may also experience fatigue, weight loss, and bone pain in advanced stages of the disease. It's important to note that these symptoms can also be caused by benign conditions, and regular check-ups and mammograms are crucial for early detection and proper diagnosis.;0.008;259.0;98.0;0.368;0.058;0.227;0.668;-0.033;-0.108;0.04
487;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) severe congenital neutropenia ?;Severe congenital neutropenia is a condition that causes affected individuals to be prone to recurrent infections. People with this condition have a shortage (deficiency) of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that plays a role in inflammation and in fighting infection. The deficiency of neutrophils, called neutropenia, is apparent at birth or soon afterward. It leads to recurrent infections beginning in infancy, including infections of the sinuses, lungs, and liver. Affected individuals can also develop fevers and inflammation of the gums (gingivitis) and skin. Approximately 40 percent of affected people have decreased bone density (osteopenia) and may develop osteoporosis, a condition that makes bones progressively more brittle and prone to fracture. In people with severe congenital neutropenia, these bone disorders can begin at any time from infancy through adulthood.  Approximately 20 percent of people with severe congenital neutropenia develop cancer of the blood-forming tissue (leukemia) or a disease of the blood and bone marrow (myelodysplastic syndrome) during adolescence.  Some people with severe congenital neutropenia have additional health problems such as seizures, developmental delay, or heart and genital abnormalities.;Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is a rare, inherited blood disorder characterized by a severely low number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that plays a crucial role in defending the body against bacterial and fungal infections. This deficiency makes individuals with SCN highly susceptible to recurrent and severe infections, often starting in infancy or early childhood. The severity of SCN can vary, with some individuals experiencing life-threatening infections, while others may have milder symptoms. Treatment options for SCN may include antibiotics to prevent infections, growth factors to stimulate neutrophil production, and in some cases, bone marrow transplantation.;0.065;168.0;93.0;0.356;0.126;0.287;0.759;0.146;0.106;0.185

490;gemini-pro;exams and tests;How to diagnose Glioblastoma ?;Is genetic testing available for glioblastoma? Genetic testing is not available for many people with glioblastoma since most of these tumors occur sporadically (by chance) and are not caused by a genetic mutation. However, genetic testing is an option for people with an inherited condition that predisposes to glioblastoma such as neurofibromatosis type 1, Turcot syndrome and Li Fraumeni syndrome. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing are possible if the disease-causing mutation in the family is known. The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) is a centralized online resource for information about genetic tests. It provides a list of laboratories performing genetic testing for neurofibromatosis type 1, Turcot syndrome and Li Fraumeni syndrome. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. How is glioblastoma diagnosed? Glioblastoma is typically diagnosed based on a physical exam that identifies characteristic symptoms and various imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A CT scan is an imaging method that uses x-rays to create pictures of cross-sections of the body, while an MRI scan uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create pictures of the brain and surrounding nerve tissues. These imaging studies will also provide information regarding the size of the tumor and which parts of the brain are affected. Surgical removal of the tumor or a small biopsy may confirm the diagnosis.;Glioblastoma, the most aggressive type of brain cancer, requires a comprehensive diagnostic approach. Initial evaluation typically involves a neurological examination and medical history. Brain imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast, play a crucial role in detecting and characterizing the tumor. Additional tests may include a biopsy, where a small tissue sample is extracted from the tumor for pathological examination. Molecular analysis, such as genetic sequencing, can provide insights into specific genetic alterations driving the tumor's growth, aiding in diagnosis and guiding personalized treatment decisions.;0.009;223.0;79.0;0.269;0.037;0.149;0.681;-0.052;-0.163;0.061

493;gemini-pro;causes;What causes Alport syndrome ?;What causes Alport syndrome? Alport syndrome may be caused by mutations in either the COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 genes. These genes each provide instructions for making one component of a protein called type IV collagen, which plays an important role in the glomeruli of the kidneys. Glomeruli are clusters of specialized blood vessels that remove water and waste products from the blood and create urine. Mutations in the genes mentioned above result in abnormalities of the type IV collagen in glomeruli, which prevents the kidneys from properly filtering the blood. As a result, blood and protein pass into the urine. Over time, the kidneys become scarred and many people with Alport syndrome develop kidney failure. Type IV collagen is also an important component of the organ of Corti, an inner ear structure that transforms sound waves into nerve impulses for the brain. Alterations in type IV collagen may result in abnormal inner ear function, which can lead to hearing loss. In addition, type IV collagen plays a role in the eye, where it helps maintain the shape of the lens and the normal color of the retina. Mutations found in Alport syndrome may affect the shape of the lenses and the color of the retina.;Alport syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins essential for maintaining the structure and function of the kidneys and hearing. It is characterized by progressive kidney disease, sensorineural hearing loss, and eye abnormalities. The most common genetic cause of Alport syndrome is mutations in the COL4A5 gene, which encodes the alpha-5 chain of type IV collagen. Mutations in this gene lead to the production of abnormal type IV collagen, a major component of the basement membranes of the kidneys, inner ear, and eyes. This abnormal collagen leads to structural defects and impaired function of these tissues, resulting in the characteristic features of Alport syndrome.;0.048;178.0;98.0;0.381;0.107;0.214;0.913;0.184;0.095;0.274

This means that both copies of the LCAT gene must have mutations in order for the condition to manifest. If an individual inherits one normal copy and one mutated copy of the gene, they will be a carrier of LCAT deficiency, but they will not have the condition themselves.;0.132;44.0;53.0;0.595;0.22;0.514;0.693;0.376;0.433;0.318

In most cases, an affected person has one affected parent. However, some people who inherit an altered gene never develop the aortic abnormalities associated with the condition; this situation is known as reduced penetrance.";Yes, familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD) is an inherited condition, often caused by genetic mutations that weaken the aortic wall. These mutations can be passed down from either parent, and inheritance patterns vary depending on the specific genetic cause. Some TAAD mutations show an autosomal dominant pattern, where inheriting one copy of the mutated gene from either parent is enough to cause the condition. Other TAAD forms exhibit an autosomal recessive pattern, where an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition. Identifying the underlying genetic variants associated with familial TAAD can aid in risk assessment, family screening, and targeted interventions to prevent aortic complications.;0.049;54.0;105.0;0.417;0.146;0.3;0.815;0.176;0.245;0.105

497;gemini-pro;exams and tests;How to diagnose Renal Artery Stenosis ?;"A health care provider can diagnose RAS by listening to the abdomen with a stethoscope and performing imaging tests. When blood flows through a narrow artery, it sometimes makes a whooshing sound, called a bruit. The health care provider may place a stethoscope on the front or the side of the abdomen to listen for this sound. The absence of this sound, however, does not exclude the possibility of RAS.
                
In some cases, RAS is found when a person has a test for another reason. For example, a health care provider may find RAS during a coronary angiogram for diagnosis of heart problems. A coronary angiogram is a procedure that uses a special dye, called contrast medium, and x rays to see how blood flows through the heart.
                
The following imaging tests are used to diagnose RAS:
                
- Duplex ultrasound. Duplex ultrasound combines traditional ultrasound with Doppler ultrasonography. Traditional ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. Doppler ultrasonography records sound waves reflected off of moving objects, such as blood, to measure their speed and other aspects of how they flow. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Anesthesia is not needed. The images can show blockage in the renal artery or blood moving through nearby arteries at a lower-than-normal speed. Ultrasound is noninvasive and low cost.  - Catheter angiogram. A catheter angiogram, also called a traditional angiogram, is a special kind of x ray in which a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is threaded through the large arteries, often from the groin, to the artery of interestin this case, the renal artery. The procedure is performed in a hospital or outpatient center by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed though a sedative may be given to lessen anxiety during the procedure. Contrast medium is injected through the catheter so the renal artery shows up more clearly on the x ray. Catheter angiogram is the gold standard for diagnosing RAS due to the high quality of the image produced. In addition, severe RAS can be treated during the same visit. However, a catheter angiogram is an invasive procedure, and a person may have side effects from the sedative or contrast medium or may have bleeding or injury to the artery from the catheter. The procedure is also more expensive than other imaging tests.  - Computerized tomographic angiography (CTA) scan. CTA scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed. Contrast medium is injected into a vein in the persons arm to better see the structure of the arteries. CTA scans require the person to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken. CTA scans are less invasive than catheter angiograms and take less time. However, the risks from the x-ray radiation still exist, and the test often requires more contrast medium than a catheter angiogram, so it may not be recommended for a person with poor kidney function.  - Magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA). MRA uses radio waves and magnets to produce detailed pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed though light sedation may be used for people with a fear of confined spaces. Contrast medium may be injected into a vein in the persons arm to better see the structure of the arteries. With most MRA scans, the person lies on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end; some newer machines are designed to allow the person to lie in a more open space. In addition to providing high-quality images noninvasively, MRA can provide a functional assessment of blood flow and organ function. However, the use of contrast medium for an MRA is not advised for people with poor kidney function because of the risk of complications to the skin and other organs if the kidneys do not remove the contrast medium well enough.";"Arteriosclerosis is the hardening and loss of elasticity of arteries, primarily caused by the buildup of plaque, which consists of cholesterol, fat, calcium, and fibrous tissue. The condition can be diagnosed through various methods:

1. Physical Examination:
   A healthcare provider can physically examine your arteries for signs of hardening or stiffness. They may feel for a pulse in your arteries and check for any irregularities in your heartbeat.

2. Blood Pressure Measurement:
   High blood pressure is a common sign of arteriosclerosis. Your healthcare provider will measure your blood pressure to check for elevated levels.

3. Blood Test:
   A blood test can measure the level of certain substances in your blood, such as cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose. High levels of these substances can indicate an increased risk of arteriosclerosis.

4. Imaging Tests:
   Imaging tests, such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRI, can help visualize your arteries and detect any abnormalities, such as narrowing or plaque buildup.

5. Angiography:
   This procedure involves inserting a catheter into an artery and injecting a contrast material. X-ray images are then taken to visualize the interior of the artery and identify any areas of narrowing or plaque buildup.

6. Stress Test:
   A stress test involves exercising on a treadmill or stationary bike while your heart rate and blood pressure are monitored. This test can help identify areas of the artery that are narrowed or blocked, causing chest pain or shortness of breath.

7. Pulse Oximetry:
   Pulse oximetry measures the amount of oxygen in your blood. Low oxygen levels may indicate poor circulation due to arteriosclerosis.

8. Echocardiogram:
   This ultrasound procedure evaluates your heart's structure and function. It can help identify any abnormalities caused by arteriosclerosis.";0.003;639.0;261.0;0.23;0.022;0.122;0.456;-0.104;-0.151;-0.059

Children born with this condition have a small stomach (microgastria) and limb abnormalities. Symptoms may include vomiting, aspiration pneumonia and growth problems. Abnormalities involving the heart, lungs, kidney and gastrointestinal system are also symptoms of this condition. This condition is caused by an error that occurs during the development of the embryo. Treatment may involve reconstructive surgery (Hunt-Lawrence pouch) to help improve the child's feeding abilities.;Microgastria limb reduction defect is a rare congenital disorder characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the stomach and the limb reduction defects. The severity of the disorder can vary, ranging from mild to severe. In severe cases, the stomach may be completely absent, and the limbs may be severely shortened or even missing. The exact cause of microgastria limb reduction defect is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treatment for microgastria limb reduction defect typically involves supportive care, such as providing nutrition and managing any complications. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to correct the limb defects. The prognosis for individuals with microgastria limb reduction defect depends on the severity of the disorder and the availability of appropriate medical care.;0.059;74.0;117.0;0.273;0.081;0.242;0.9;0.132;0.136;0.125

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.;Multisystemic smooth muscle dysfunction syndrome (MSMDS) is characterized by the dysfunction of smooth muscles in multiple organ systems. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including gastrointestinal problems (such as abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea), urinary problems (such as difficulty urinating and incontinence), cardiovascular problems (such as low blood pressure and fainting), and respiratory problems (such as shortness of breath and wheezing).

507;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita ?;Mutations in the NR0B1 gene cause X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita. The NR0B1 gene provides instructions to make a protein called DAX1. This protein plays an important role in the development and function of several hormone-producing (endocrine) tissues including the adrenal glands, two hormone-secreting glands in the brain (the hypothalamus and pituitary), and the gonads (ovaries in females and testes in males). The hormones produced by these glands control many important body functions.  Some NR0B1 mutations result in the production of an inactive version of the DAX1 protein, while other mutations delete the entire gene. The resulting shortage of DAX1 disrupts the normal development and function of hormone-producing tissues in the body. The signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism occur when endocrine glands do not produce the right amounts of certain hormones.;X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC) is caused by mutations in the NROB1 gene, which encodes the nuclear receptor protein DAX1. DAX1 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development and function of the adrenal glands, gonads, and other tissues. Mutations in the NROB1 gene can lead to the production of a non-functional DAX1 protein, resulting in impaired adrenal gland development and function. This can lead to a deficiency of adrenal hormones, such as cortisol and aldosterone, which are essential for various physiological processes. Additionally, AHC can be associated with hypogonadism, due to the role of DAX1 in gonadal development.;0.103;115.0;92.0;0.388;0.146;0.299;0.82;0.217;0.149;0.285
508;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Progressive deafness with stapes fixation ?;Progressive deafness with stapes fixation, also known as Thies Reis syndrome, is a form of conductive or mixed hearing loss caused by fixation of the stapes. The stapes is one of the tiny bones in the middle ear. It rests in the entrance to the inner ear, allowing sounds to pass to the inner ear. If it becomes fixated, sound waves cannot pass through to the inner ear, resulting in loss of hearing. This condition may be associated with a number of conditions, including ostosclerosis, Paget's disease and osteogenesis imperfecta, or it may be found in isolation. It may also result from chronic ear infections (otitis media with tympanosclerosis). The progression of hearing loss is generally slow, rarely profound, and usually resolves following treatment. Conductive hearing loss can be restored through surgery or hearing aids. Sensorineural hearing loss can be managed with hearing aids or cochlear implants.;Progressive deafness with stapes fixation is a condition in which the stapes bone, one of the three smallest bones in the body located in the middle ear, becomes fixed or immobile due to various causes such as otosclerosis, a condition characterized by abnormal bone growth in the middle ear, or other underlying medical conditions. This immobility prevents the proper transmission of sound vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear, resulting in progressive hearing loss, often starting as low-frequency sounds and gradually affecting higher frequencies over time. Treatment options may include hearing aids, surgery to replace the stapes bone, or other interventions aimed at improving hearing or preventing further deterioration.;0.082;136.0;99.0;0.403;0.13;0.264;0.839;0.172;0.12;0.222

People with this condition are born with extra eyelashes (distichiasis) and develop puffiness or swelling (lymphedema) of the limbs by the time they are in their forties. The abnormal eyelashes, which grow along the inner lining of the eyelid, often touch the eyeball and can cause damage to the clear covering of the eye (cornea). Other eye problems such as an irregular curvature of the cornea causing blurred vision (astigmatism) or scarring of the cornea may also occur. Other health problems, varicose veins, droopy eyelids (ptosis), heart abnormalities, and an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), may also be present. Lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome is caused by mutations in the FOXC2 gene. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.;Lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome is a rare congenital disorder characterized by the presence of lymphedema, a condition causing tissue swelling due to impaired lymphatic drainage, and distichiasis, an abnormal growth of an additional row of eyelashes near the openings of the meibomian glands. It is caused by mutations in the FOXC2 gene, leading to a defective lymphatic system and eyelash development. Symptoms typically appear at birth or early infancy, including swollen hands, feet, and/or genitals, skin changes, and excessive eyelashes. Management involves reducing swelling through therapies like massage, compression garments, and surgical procedures, and addressing any associated complications.

511;gemini-pro;considerations;What to do for Irritable Bowel Syndrome in Children ?;"- Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder, meaning it is a problem caused by changes in how the GI tract works. Children with a functional GI disorder have frequent symptoms, but the GI tract does not become damaged.  - IBS is not a disease; it is a group of symptoms that occur together.  - The most common symptoms of IBS are abdominal pain or discomfort, often reported as cramping, along with diarrhea, constipation, or both.  - The causes of IBS are not well understood. The possible causes of IBS in children include brain-gut signal problems, GI motor problems, hypersensitivity, mental health problems, bacterial gastroenteritis, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and genetics.  - To diagnose IBS, a health care provider will conduct a physical exam and take a complete medical history. The medical history will include questions about the childs symptoms, family members with GI disorders, recent infections, medications, and stressful events related to the onset of symptoms. IBS is diagnosed when the physical exam does not show any cause for the childs symptoms and the child meets all of the following criteria:      - has had symptoms at least once per week for at least 2 months    - is growing as expected    - is not showing any signs that suggest another cause for the symptoms    - Though there is no cure for IBS, the symptoms can be treated with a combination of the following:      - changes in eating, diet, and nutrition    - medications    - probiotics    - therapies for mental health problems";In children with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), dietary changes can help manage symptoms. A low FODMAP diet, excluding foods high in fermentable carbohydrates, may reduce abdominal pain and discomfort. Additionally, increasing fiber intake from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can aid in stool regulation. Probiotics, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains, have shown promise in alleviating IBS symptoms. Regular physical activity and stress management techniques can also be beneficial. In severe cases, medications like antispasmodics or antidepressants may be considered.

513;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Polycythemia Vera ?;"Polycythemia vera (POL-e-si-THEE-me-ah VAY-rah or VE-rah), or PV, is a rare blood disease in which your body makes too many red blood cells.
                
The extra red blood cells make your blood thicker than normal. As a result, blood clots can form more easily. These clots can block blood flow through your arteries and veins, which can cause a heart attack or stroke.
                
Thicker blood also doesn't flow as quickly to your body as normal blood. Slowed blood flow prevents your organs from getting enough oxygen, which can cause serious problems, such as angina (an-JI-nuh or AN-juh-nuh) and heart failure. (Angina is chest pain or discomfort.)
                
Overview
                
Red blood cells carry oxygen to all parts of your body. They also remove carbon dioxide (a waste product) from your body's cells and carry it to the lungs to be exhaled.
                
Red blood cells are made in your bone marrowa sponge-like tissue inside the bones. White blood cells and platelets (PLATE-lets) also are made in your bone marrow. White blood cells help fight infection. Platelets stick together to seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding.
                
If you have PV, your bone marrow makes too many red blood cells. It also can make too many white blood cells and platelets.
                
A mutation, or change, in the body's JAK2 gene is the major cause of PV. This gene makes a protein that helps the body produce blood cells. What causes the change in the JAK2 gene isn't known. PV generally isn't inheritedthat is, passed from parents to children through genes.
                
PV develops slowly and may not cause symptoms for years. The disease often is found during routine blood tests done for other reasons.
                
When signs and symptoms are present, they're the result of the thick blood that occurs with PV. This thickness slows the flow of oxygen-rich blood to all parts of your body. Without enough oxygen, many parts of your body won't work normally.
                
For example, slower blood flow deprives your arms, legs, lungs, and eyes of the oxygen they need. This can cause headaches, dizziness, itching, and vision problems, such as blurred or double vision.
                
Outlook
                
PV is a serious, chronic (ongoing) disease that can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated. PV has no cure, but treatments can help control the disease and its complications.
                
PV is treated with procedures, medicines, and other methods. You may need one or more treatments to manage the disease.";Polycythemia vera (PV) is a rare blood cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many red blood cells.

514;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) systemic scleroderma ?;"Systemic scleroderma is an autoimmune disorder that affects the skin and internal organs. Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. The word ""scleroderma"" means hard skin in Greek, and the condition is characterized by the buildup of scar tissue (fibrosis) in the skin and other organs. The condition is also called systemic sclerosis because the fibrosis can affect organs other than the skin. Fibrosis is due to the excess production of a tough protein called collagen, which normally strengthens and supports connective tissues throughout the body.  The signs and symptoms of systemic scleroderma usually begin with episodes of Raynaud phenomenon, which can occur weeks to years before fibrosis. In Raynaud phenomenon, the fingers and toes of affected individuals turn white or blue in response to cold temperature or other stresses. This effect occurs because of problems with the small vessels that carry blood to the extremities. Another early sign of systemic scleroderma is puffy or swollen hands before thickening and hardening of the skin due to fibrosis. Skin thickening usually occurs first in the fingers (called sclerodactyly) and may also involve the hands and face. In addition, people with systemic scleroderma often have open sores (ulcers) on their fingers, painful bumps under the skin (calcinosis), or small clusters of enlarged blood vessels just under the skin (telangiectasia).  Fibrosis can also affect internal organs and can lead to impairment or failure of the affected organs. The most commonly affected organs are the esophagus, heart, lungs, and kidneys. Internal organ involvement may be signaled by heartburn, difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), high blood pressure (hypertension), kidney problems, shortness of breath, diarrhea, or impairment of the muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract (intestinal pseudo-obstruction).  There are three types of systemic scleroderma, defined by the tissues affected in the disorder. In one type of systemic scleroderma, known as limited cutaneous systemic scleroderma, fibrosis usually affects only the hands, arms, and face. Limited cutaneous systemic scleroderma used to be known as CREST syndrome, which is named for the common features of the condition: calcinosis, Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal motility dysfunction, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia. In another type of systemic scleroderma, known as diffuse cutaneous systemic scleroderma, the fibrosis affects large areas of skin, including the torso and the upper arms and legs, and often involves internal organs. In diffuse cutaneous systemic scleroderma, the condition worsens quickly and organ damage occurs earlier than in other types of the condition. In the third type of systemic scleroderma, called systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma (""sine"" means without in Latin), fibrosis affects one or more internal organs but not the skin.  Approximately 15 percent to 25 percent of people with features of systemic scleroderma also have signs and symptoms of another condition that affects connective tissue, such as polymyositis, dermatomyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjgren syndrome, or systemic lupus erythematosus. The combination of systemic scleroderma with other connective tissue abnormalities is known as scleroderma overlap syndrome.";Systemic sclerosis is a rare chronic autoimmune disease that affects the skin, blood vessels, and internal organs.

515;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is fish-eye disease inherited ?;This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.;Fish-eye disease, also known as congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED), is an inherited eye condition that affects the cornea, the clear front part of the eye. It is caused by mutations in certain genes that are responsible for the development and maintenance of the cornea. The most common genetic cause of fish-eye disease is a mutation in the SLC4A11 gene, which encodes a protein that is involved in the transport of ions and fluid across the cornea. Inherited eye conditions like fish-eye disease are typically passed down from parents to children through genetic mutations, resulting in a higher chance of developing the condition within families.;0.013;44.0;91.0;0.222;0.016;0.141;0.438;-0.07;0.012;-0.152
516;gemini-pro;considerations;What to do for What I need to know about Erectile Dysfunction ?;- Erectile dysfunction (ED) is when you cannot get or keep an erection firm enough to have sex. You may have ED if you      - can get an erection sometimes, though not every time    - can get an erection, yet it does not last long enough for sex    - are unable to get an erection at all    - An erection occurs when blood flow into the penis increases, making the penis larger and firmer. Hormones, blood vessels, nerves, and muscles all work together to cause an erection.  - ED often has more than one cause. Many diseases can damage nerves, arteries, and muscles.  - To find the cause of your ED, your doctor may      - take your medical and sexual history    - ask you questions about your mental health    - give you a physical exam    - test your blood    - give you a nighttime erection test    - perform an injection test    - perform a Doppler penile ultrasound    - Your doctor can offer you a number of treatments for ED. For many men, the answer is as simple as taking a pill. Other men have to try two or three options before they find a treatment that works for them.  - You can prevent many of the causes of ED by making healthy lifestyle choices. Following a healthy diet may help prevent ED. Quitting smoking and getting physical activity are also important ways to prevent ED.;Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common problem that affects many men. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including physical, psychological, and lifestyle factors. Symptoms of ED can include difficulty getting or maintaining an erection, decreased interest in sex, and difficulty reaching orgasm.

523;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to Cowden syndrome ?;"Changes involving at least four genes, PTEN, SDHB, SDHD, and KLLN, have been identified in people with Cowden syndrome or Cowden-like syndrome.  Most cases of Cowden syndrome and a small percentage of cases of Cowden-like syndrome result from mutations in the PTEN gene. The protein produced from the PTEN gene is a tumor suppressor, which means that it normally prevents cells from growing and dividing (proliferating) too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Mutations in the PTEN gene prevent the protein from regulating cell proliferation effectively, leading to uncontrolled cell division and the formation of hamartomas and cancerous tumors. The PTEN gene likely has other important functions within cells; however, it is unclear how mutations in this gene cause the other features of Cowden syndrome, such as macrocephaly and intellectual disability.  Other cases of Cowden syndrome and Cowden-like syndrome result from changes involving the KLLN gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called killin. Like the protein produced from the PTEN gene, killin probably acts as a tumor suppressor. The genetic change that causes Cowden syndrome and Cowden-like syndrome is known as promoter hypermethylation. The promoter is a region of DNA near the gene that controls gene activity (expression). Hypermethylation occurs when too many small molecules called methyl groups are attached to the promoter region. The extra methyl groups reduce the expression of the KLLN gene, which means that less killin is produced. A reduced amount of killin may allow abnormal cells to survive and proliferate inappropriately, which can lead to the formation of tumors.  A small percentage of people with Cowden syndrome or Cowden-like syndrome have variations in the SDHB or SDHD gene. These genes provide instructions for making parts of an enzyme called succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which is important for energy production in the cell. This enzyme also plays a role in signaling pathways that regulate cell survival and proliferation. Variations in the SDHB or SDHD gene alter the function of the SDH enzyme. Studies suggest that the defective enzyme may allow cells to grow and divide unchecked, leading to the formation of hamartomas and cancerous tumors. However, researchers are uncertain whether the identified SDHB and SDHD gene variants are directly associated with Cowden syndrome and Cowden-like syndrome. Some of the variants described above have also been identified in people without the features of these conditions.  When Cowden syndrome and Cowden-like syndrome are not related to changes in the PTEN, SDHB, SDHD, or KLLN genes, the cause of the conditions is unknown.";Cowden syndrome is caused by mutations in the PTEN tumor suppressor gene, located on chromosome 10q23.31. This gene encodes a protein called phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. Mutations in PTEN lead to an overgrowth of cells, resulting in the development of benign hamartomas and an increased risk of certain types of cancer, including breast, thyroid, and endometrial cancers. Additionally, individuals with Cowden syndrome may exhibit macrocephaly (large head circumference), intellectual disability, and characteristic facial features.;0.002;374.0;81.0;0.268;0.069;0.196;0.783;-0.013;-0.134;0.11

HDL is a molecule that transports cholesterol and certain fats called phospholipids through the bloodstream from the body's tissues to the liver. Once in the liver, cholesterol and phospholipids are redistributed to other tissues or removed from the body. HDL is often referred to as ""good cholesterol"" because high levels of this substance reduce the chances of developing heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. People with familial HDL deficiency may develop cardiovascular disease at a relatively young age, often before age 50.  Severely reduced levels of HDL in the blood is a characteristic feature of a related disorder called Tangier disease. People with Tangier disease have additional signs and symptoms, such as disturbances in nerve function; enlarged, orange-colored tonsils; and clouding of the clear covering of the eye (corneal clouding). However, people with familial HDL deficiency do not have these additional features.";"Familial HDL deficiency is a rare genetic disorder characterized by extremely low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in the blood. HDL cholesterol, often referred to as ""good cholesterol,"" plays a crucial role in removing excess cholesterol from the body and transporting it back to the liver for elimination.

                    - After Merkel cell carcinoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.    - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.    - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.    - The following stages are used for Merkel cell carcinoma:          - Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ)     - Stage IA     - Stage IB     - Stage IIA     - Stage IIB     - Stage IIC     - Stage IIIA     - Stage IIIB     - Stage IV
                
                
                    After Merkel cell carcinoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.    The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:         -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen may be used to check for primary small cell lung cancer, or to find Merkel cell carcinoma that has spread. A CT scan of the head and neck may also be used to find Merkel cell carcinoma that has spread to the lymph nodes. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.    -  Lymph node biopsy : There are two main types of lymph node biopsy used to stage Merkel cell carcinoma.               -  Sentinel lymph node biopsy : The removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor. A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor. The substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes. The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes.      -  Lymph node dissection : A surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. For a regional lymph node dissection, some of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed. For a radical lymph node dissection, most or all of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy.             -   Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if Merkel cell carcinoma spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually cancerous Merkel cells. The disease is metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma, not liver cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for Merkel cell carcinoma:
                    Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ)    In stage 0, the tumor is a group of abnormal cells that remain in the place where they first formed and have not spread. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread to lymph nodes or distant parts of the body.       Stage IA    In stage IA, the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller at its widest point and no cancer is found when the lymph nodes are checked under a microscope.       Stage IB    In stage IB, the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller at its widest point and no swollen lymph nodes are found by a physical exam or imaging tests.       Stage IIA    In stage IIA, the tumor is larger than 2 centimeters and no cancer is found when the lymph nodes are checked under a microscope.       Stage IIB    In stage IIB, the tumor is larger than 2 centimeters and no swollen lymph nodes are found by a physical exam or imaging tests.       Stage IIC    In stage IIC, the tumor may be any size and has spread to nearby bone, muscle, connective tissue, or cartilage. It has not spread to lymph nodes or distant parts of the body.       Stage IIIA    In stage IIIA, the tumor may be any size and may have spread to nearby bone, muscle, connective tissue, or cartilage. Cancer is found in the lymph nodes when they are checked under a microscope.       Stage IIIB    In stage IIIB, the tumor may be any size and may have spread to nearby bone, muscle, connective tissue, or cartilage. Cancer has spread to the lymph nodes near the tumor and is found by a physical exam or imaging test. The lymph nodes are removed and cancer is found in the lymph nodes when they are checked under a microscope. There may also be a second tumor, which is either:            - Between the primary tumor and nearby lymph nodes; or     - Farther away from the center of the body than the primary tumor is.              Stage IV    In stage IV, the tumor may be any size and has spread to distant parts of the body, such as the liver, lung, bone, or brain.";"Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive skin cancer that arises from Merkel cells, specialized touch receptor cells found in the skin. The stages of MCC are determined by the extent of the tumor's growth and spread. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for MCC is as follows:

**Stage 0:** The tumor is confined to the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin.

**Stage I:** The tumor is localized to the skin and is less than 2 centimeters (cm) in diameter.

**Stage II:** The tumor is localized to the skin and is between 2 cm and 5 cm in diameter, or there are multiple tumors, each less than 2 cm in diameter.

Options include medication, physical therapy, exercise, heat therapy (including microwave and ultrasound), orthotics and assistive devices, and rest.  The standard treatment for dermatomyositis is a corticosteroid drug, given either in pill form or intravenously.  Immunosuppressant drugs, such as azathioprine and methotrexate, may reduce inflammation in people who do not respond well to prednisone.  Periodic treatment using intravenous immunoglobulin can also improve recovery.  Other immunosuppressive agents used to treat the inflammation associated with dermatomyositis include cyclosporine A, cyclophosphamide, and tacrolimus.  Physical therapy is usually recommended to prevent muscle atrophy and to regain muscle strength and range of motion.  Many individuals with dermatomyositis may need a topical ointment, such as topical corticosteroids, for their skin disorder.  They should wear a high-protection sunscreen and protective clothing.  Surgery may be required to remove calcium deposits that cause nerve pain and recurrent infections.;Dermatomyositis treatments aim to reduce inflammation, improve muscle strength, and manage skin symptoms. Medications like corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs are commonly used to suppress the overactive immune response. Physical therapy and exercise programs help maintain and improve muscle strength and function. Skin care measures, including moisturizers, sunscreen, and protective clothing, are essential to manage skin rashes and prevent complications. In severe cases, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy or plasmapheresis may be considered to remove harmful antibodies from the blood. Additionally, lifestyle modifications such as rest, stress management, and a healthy diet can support overall well-being and aid in the management of Dermatomyositis.;0.04;147.0;96.0;0.372;0.103;0.208;0.792;0.086;0.004;0.167
533;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Back Pain ?;"If you've ever groaned, ""Oh, my aching back!"", you are not alone. Back pain is one of the most common medical problems, affecting 8 out of 10 people at some point during their lives. Back pain can range from a dull, constant ache to a sudden, sharp pain. Acute back pain comes on suddenly and usually lasts from a few days to a few weeks. Back pain is called chronic if it lasts for more than three months.    Most back pain goes away on its own, though it may take awhile. Taking over-the-counter pain relievers and resting can help. However, staying in bed for more than 1 or 2 days can make it worse.     If your back pain is severe or doesn't improve after three days, you should call your health care provider. You should also get medical attention if you have back pain following an injury.    Treatment for back pain depends on what kind of pain you have, and what is causing it. It may include hot or cold packs, exercise, medicines, injections, complementary treatments, and sometimes surgery.    NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases";Back pain is a common condition that affects people of all ages. It can range from a minor annoyance to a debilitating condition that interferes with everyday activities. Back pain can be caused by a variety of factors, including muscle strains, ligament sprains, herniated discs, spinal stenosis, and arthritis. It can also be caused by poor posture, obesity, and lack of exercise. In most cases, back pain is not a serious condition and can be treated with rest, ice, heat, and over-the-counter pain relievers. However, if back pain is severe or does not improve with home treatment, it is important to see a doctor to rule out any underlying medical conditions.;0.047;183.0;105.0;0.292;0.069;0.208;0.686;0.104;0.043;0.164

536;gemini-pro;information;Do you have information about Pain Relievers;Summary : Pain relievers are medicines that reduce or relieve headaches, sore muscles, arthritis, or other aches and pains. There are many different pain medicines, and each one has advantages and risks. Some types of pain respond better to certain medicines than others. Each person may also have a slightly different response to a pain reliever.     Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are good for many types of pain. There are two main types of OTC pain medicines: acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Aspirin, naproxen (Aleve), and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) are examples of OTC NSAIDs.    If OTC medicines don't relieve your pain, your doctor may prescribe something stronger. Many NSAIDs are also available at higher prescription doses. The most powerful pain relievers are narcotics. They are very effective, but they can sometimes have serious side effects. Because of the risks, you must use them only under a doctor's supervision.    There are many things you can do to help ease pain. Pain relievers are just one part of a pain treatment plan.;Pain relievers are medications designed to reduce or eliminate pain. They work through various mechanisms, including blocking pain signals from reaching the brain, reducing inflammation, or altering the perception of pain. Common types of pain relievers include over-the-counter options like acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil), and naproxen (Aleve), as well as prescription medications like opioids (e.g., oxycodone, hydrocodone), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and corticosteroids. Pain relievers can provide temporary relief from pain associated with various conditions such as headaches, muscle aches, arthritis, menstrual cramps, and injuries. However, it's crucial to use pain relievers responsibly, follow dosage instructions, and consult a healthcare professional if pain persists or worsens. Some pain relievers may have side effects or interact with other medications, so it's essential to discuss their use with a healthcare provider.;0.045;163.0;125.0;0.354;0.09;0.198;0.865;0.162;0.135;0.186
537;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) primary myelofibrosis ?;Primary myelofibrosis is a condition characterized by the buildup of scar tissue (fibrosis) in the bone marrow, the tissue that produces blood cells. Because of the fibrosis, the bone marrow is unable to make enough normal blood cells. The shortage of blood cells causes many of the signs and symptoms of primary myelofibrosis.  Initially, most people with primary myelofibrosis have no signs or symptoms. Eventually, fibrosis can lead to a reduction in the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. A shortage of red blood cells (anemia) often causes extreme tiredness (fatigue) or shortness of breath. A loss of white blood cells can lead to an increased number of infections, and a reduction of platelets can cause easy bleeding or bruising.  Because blood cell formation (hematopoiesis) in the bone marrow is disrupted, other organs such as the spleen or liver may begin to produce blood cells. This process, called extramedullary hematopoiesis, often leads to an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) or an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly). People with splenomegaly may feel pain or fullness in the abdomen, especially below the ribs on the left side. Other common signs and symptoms of primary myelofibrosis include fever, night sweats, and bone pain.  Primary myelofibrosis is most commonly diagnosed in people aged 50 to 80 but can occur at any age.;Primary myelofibrosis (PMF), also known as chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis, is a rare type of blood cancer that affects the bone marrow. It is characterized by the formation of fibrous tissue in the bone marrow, which leads to scarring and thickening. This scarring can interfere with the production of blood cells, resulting in anemia, fatigue, and other symptoms. PMF is a chronic disease that can progress over time, and there is no cure.

539;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) MPV17-related hepatocerebral mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome ?;MPV17-related hepatocerebral mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome is an inherited disorder that can cause liver disease and neurological problems. The signs and symptoms of this condition begin in infancy and typically include vomiting, diarrhea, and an inability to grow or gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive). Many affected infants have a buildup of a chemical called lactic acid in the body (lactic acidosis) and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Within the first weeks of life, infants develop liver disease that quickly progresses to liver failure. The liver is frequently enlarged (hepatomegaly) and liver cells often have a reduced ability to release a digestive fluid called bile (cholestasis). Rarely, affected children develop liver cancer. After the onset of liver disease, many affected infants develop neurological problems, which can include developmental delay, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and reduced sensation in the limbs (peripheral neuropathy). Individuals with MPV17-related hepatocerebral mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome typically survive only into infancy or early childhood.  MPV17-related hepatocerebral mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome is most frequently seen in the Navajo population of the southwestern United States. In this population, the condition is known as Navajo neurohepatopathy. People with Navajo neurohepatopathy tend to have a longer life expectancy than those with MPV17-related hepatocerebral mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. In addition to the signs and symptoms described above, people with Navajo neurohepatopathy may have problems with sensing pain that can lead to painless bone fractures and self-mutilation of the fingers or toes. Individuals with Navajo neurohepatopathy may lack feeling in the clear front covering of the eye (corneal anesthesia), which can lead to open sores and scarring on the cornea, resulting in impaired vision. The cause of these additional features is unknown.;MPV17-related hepatocerebral mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome is a rare, inherited disorder caused by mutations in the MPV17 gene, which encodes a protein involved in mitochondrial DNA replication and maintenance. This leads to a severe deficiency of mitochondrial DNA in the liver and brain, resulting in a range of symptoms, including liver failure, encephalopathy, seizures, and developmental delay. The exact underlying mechanisms by which mitochondrial DNA depletion causes these symptoms are not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to impaired energy production and cellular dysfunction. Treatment options are limited and supportive, focusing on managing the symptoms and complications of the disease.;0.021;258.0;94.0;0.234;0.065;0.168;0.786;0.008;-0.15;0.173

542;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Thalassemia ?;Thalassemias are inherited blood disorders. If you have one, your body makes fewer healthy red blood cells and less hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein that carries oxygen to the body. That leads to anemia. Thalassemias occur most often among people of Italian, Greek, Middle Eastern, Southern Asian, and African descent.    Thalassemias can be mild or severe. Some people have no symptoms or mild anemia. The most common severe type in the United States is called Cooley's anemia. It usually appears during the first two years of life. People with it may have severe anemia, slowed growth and delayed puberty, and problems with the spleen, liver, heart, or bones.    Doctors diagnose thalassemias using blood tests. Treatments include blood transfusions and treatment to remove excess iron from the body. If you have mild symptoms or no symptoms, you may not need treatment. In some severe cases, you may need a bone marrow transplant.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute;Thalassemia is a group of inherited blood disorders that reduce the production of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and pale skin. Thalassemia is caused by mutations in the genes that control the production of hemoglobin. These mutations can be passed down from parents to children, or they can occur spontaneously. There are two main types of thalassemia: alpha thalassemia and beta thalassemia. Alpha thalassemia is caused by mutations in the genes that control the production of alpha globin, one of the two proteins that make up hemoglobin. Beta thalassemia is caused by mutations in the genes that control the production of beta globin, the other protein that makes up hemoglobin.;0.029;150.0;119.0;0.325;0.068;0.212;0.797;0.063;0.0;0.126
543;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to Kearns-Sayre syndrome ?;Kearns-Sayre syndrome is a condition caused by defects in mitochondria, which are structures within cells that use oxygen to convert the energy from food into a form cells can use. This process is called oxidative phosphorylation. Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the nucleus (nuclear DNA), mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA, called mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). This type of DNA contains many genes essential for normal mitochondrial function. People with Kearns-Sayre syndrome have a single, large deletion of mtDNA, ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 DNA building blocks (nucleotides). The cause of the deletion in affected individuals is unknown.  The mtDNA deletions that cause Kearns-Sayre syndrome result in the loss of genes important for mitochondrial protein formation and oxidative phosphorylation. The most common deletion removes 4,997 nucleotides, which includes twelve mitochondrial genes. Deletions of mtDNA result in impairment of oxidative phosphorylation and a decrease in cellular energy production. Regardless of which genes are deleted, all steps of oxidative phosphorylation are affected. Researchers have not determined how these deletions lead to the specific signs and symptoms of Kearns-Sayre syndrome, although the features of the condition are probably related to a lack of cellular energy. It has been suggested that eyes are commonly affected by mitochondrial defects because they are especially dependent on mitochondria for energy.;Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS) is a mitochondrial disorder often caused by large-scale deletions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). These deletions result in a decreased number of mitochondria and abnormal mitochondrial function, leading to a range of clinical symptoms including progressive external ophthalmoplegia, retinopathy, cardiac conduction defects, and muscle weakness. In addition to large-scale deletions, KSS can also be caused by point mutations or insertions in mtDNA, as well as mutations in nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins or factors involved in mtDNA maintenance.;0.009;203.0;77.0;0.274;0.06;0.167;0.823;0.03;-0.024;0.082

546;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is familial erythrocytosis inherited ?;Familial erythrocytosis can have different inheritance patterns depending on the gene involved.  When the condition is caused by mutations in the EPOR, EGLN1, or EPAS1 gene, it has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most affected individuals inherit the altered gene from one affected parent.  When familial erythrocytosis is caused by mutations in the VHL gene, it has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Autosomal recessive inheritance means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.;Yes, familial erythrocytosis is an inherited condition. It is characterized by an increased red blood cell count, which is typically caused by a mutation in one of several genes involved in the production or regulation of red blood cells. These mutations can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner, meaning that they can be passed down from either parent to a child. In some cases, familial erythrocytosis can also be caused by acquired mutations that occur after birth, rather than being inherited.;0.035;112.0;79.0;0.39;0.073;0.237;0.83;0.135;0.087;0.18
547;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Beta-thalassemia ?;Beta-thalassemia is a blood disorder that reduces the body's production of hemoglobin. Low levels of hemoglobin lead to a shortage of mature red blood cells and a lack of oxygen in the body. Affected people have anemia, which can cause paleness, weakness, fatigue, and more serious complications. Severe beta-thalassemia is called thalassemia major or Cooleys anemia. Thalassemia intermedia is a less severe form. Beta-thalassemia is caused by mutations in the HBB gene and is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. People who have only one HBB gene mutation may have no symptoms or develop mild symptoms, and are said to have thalassemia minor. Treatment depends on the severity in each person and may include transfusions, folic acid supplementation, iron chelation, and/or bone marrow transplantation (the only definitive cure).;Beta-thalassemia is a hereditary blood disorder characterized by the body's inability to produce a normal amount of beta-globin, a protein component of hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying molecule in red blood cells. This leads to the production of abnormal hemoglobin and a shortage of healthy red blood cells, resulting in anemia. Beta-thalassemia can range from a mild condition to a severe, life-threatening disease, depending on the severity of the genetic mutation and the amount of beta-globin produced. Individuals with beta-thalassemia may experience symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, pale skin, shortness of breath, and an enlarged spleen. Treatment options for beta-thalassemia vary depending on the severity of the condition and may include blood transfusions, medications, and in severe cases, a bone marrow transplant.;0.04;119.0;104.0;0.392;0.105;0.316;0.844;0.225;0.198;0.249

These studies are aimed at increasing knowledge about these disorders and finding ways to prevent, treat, and cure them.;Opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome (OMS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by involuntary eye movements, muscle spasms and sometimes other neurological abnormalities. Since the underlying cause of OMS is often unknown, treatment focuses on managing symptoms. However, clinical trials are currently investigating potential treatments that may target the underlying mechanisms of the disorder. These include studies exploring the use of immunotherapies, such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and rituximab, to suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation in the brain. Other trials are looking at the effects of medications like levetiracetam and valproic acid, which are typically used to treat seizures, but may also help control muscle spasms associated with OMS. Additionally, research is ongoing to investigate the role of genetic factors in OMS, with the aim of identifying potential genetic markers that may be associated with the condition.;0.011;31.0;126.0;0.217;0.027;0.15;0.53;0.012;0.195;-0.161

IgA is an antibodya protein made by the immune system to protect the body from foreign substances such as bacteria or viruses. Most people with IgA nephropathy receive care from a nephrologist, a doctor who specializes in treating people with kidney disease.;IgA Nephropathy, also known as Berger's disease, is a kidney condition characterized by the deposition of immunoglobulin A (IgA) immune complexes in the glomeruli, the tiny filters in the kidneys that help remove waste products from the blood. This deposition leads to inflammation and damage to the glomeruli, impairing their ability to filter waste products effectively. IgA Nephropathy can range from a mild condition with no noticeable symptoms to a more severe form that can progress to kidney failure if left untreated. Early diagnosis and proper management, including medications to reduce inflammation and slow disease progression, blood pressure control, and lifestyle modifications, are essential to help preserve kidney function and prevent complications.;0.103;62.0;102.0;0.298;0.115;0.231;0.913;0.231;0.335;0.13

Lymphedema is usually present at birth or develops in infancy. It typically occurs on both sides of the body and can worsen over time. Other symptoms may include accumulation of fluid in the scrotum in males (hydrocele), upslanting toenails, deep creases in the toes, wart-like growths, prominent leg veins, and/or cellulitis. Milroy disease is sometimes caused by changes (mutations) in the FLT4 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In many cases, the cause remains unknown. Treatment may include lymphedema therapy to improve function and alleviate symptoms.;Milroy disease, also known as hereditary lymphedema, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormal development and function of the lymphatic system. Inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, it is caused by mutations in genes involved in the formation and maintenance of lymphatic vessels. Key features include chronic swelling, typically in the lower extremities, due to impaired lymphatic drainage. Early signs may present during infancy or childhood, with gradual progression over time leading to tissue thickening, skin changes, and increased susceptibility to infections. Treatment focuses on conservative measures such as compression therapy, elevation, and meticulous skin care. While there is no cure, early diagnosis and management can help alleviate symptoms and prevent complications.;0.051;97.0;108.0;0.415;0.101;0.171;0.881;0.201;0.188;0.212
553;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency ?;"Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency is an inherited condition that disrupts the normal breakdown of fats in the body, resulting in an increase of certain kinds of fats.  People with familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency typically develop signs and symptoms before age 10, with one-quarter showing symptoms by age 1. The first symptom of this condition is usually abdominal pain, which can vary from mild to severe. The abdominal pain is often due to inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). These episodes of pancreatitis begin as sudden (acute) attacks. If left untreated, pancreatitis can develop into a chronic condition that can damage the pancreas and, in rare cases, be life-threatening.  Affected individuals may also have an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). The higher the levels of fat in the body, the larger the liver and spleen become. As fat levels rise, certain white blood cells called macrophages take in excess fat in an attempt to rid fat from the bloodstream. After taking in fat, the macrophages travel to the liver and spleen, where the fatty cells accumulate.  Approximately half of individuals with familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency develop small yellow deposits of fat under the skin called eruptive xanthomas. These fat deposits most commonly appear on the trunk, buttocks, knees, and arms. Eruptive xanthomas are small (about 1 millimeter in diameter), but individual xanthomas can cluster together to form larger patches. They are generally not painful unless exposed to repeated friction or abrasion. Eruptive xanthomas begin to appear when fat intake increases and levels rise; the deposits disappear when fat intake slows and levels decrease.  The blood of people with familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency can have a milky appearance due to its high fat content. When fat levels get very high in people with this condition, fats can accumulate in blood vessels in the tissue that lines the back of the eye (the retina). The fat buildup gives this tissue a pale pink appearance when examined (lipemia retinalis). This fat accumulation does not affect vision and will disappear once fats from the diet are reduced and levels in the body decrease.  In people with familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency, increased fat levels can also cause neurological features, such as depression, memory loss, and mild intellectual decline (dementia). These problems are remedied when dietary fat levels normalize.";Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency (FPLD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of lipid metabolism characterized by markedly reduced or absent lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, resulting in impaired hydrolysis of triglycerides in chylomicrons and very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs). This leads to elevated levels of chylomicrons and VLDLs in the bloodstream, a condition known as hypertriglyceridemia. FPLD can manifest in a range of clinical presentations, including recurrent pancreatitis, eruptive xanthomas, hepatosplenomegaly, and lipemia retinalis. Early diagnosis and management, typically involving dietary modifications, weight loss, and lipid-lowering medications, are essential to prevent complications and improve long-term outcomes.;0.003;348.0;89.0;0.233;0.041;0.148;0.648;-0.11;-0.193;-0.028
554;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is atopic dermatitis inherited ?;"Allergic disorders tend to run in families; having a parent with atopic dermatitis, asthma, or hay fever raises the chances a person will develop atopic dermatitis. When associated with FLG gene mutations, atopic dermatitis follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which means one copy of the altered FLG gene in each cell is sufficient to increase the risk of the disorder. Individuals with two altered copies of the gene are more likely to develop the disorder and can have more severe signs and symptoms than individuals with a single altered copy. When associated with other genetic factors, the inheritance pattern is unclear.  People with changes in one of the genes associated with atopic dermatitis, including FLG, inherit an increased risk of this condition, not the condition itself. Not all people with this condition have a mutation in an associated gene, and not all people with a variation in an associated gene will develop the disorder.";Atopy is an individual's predisposition to produce IgE antibodies in response to common allergens.

555;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to Laron syndrome ?;"Laron syndrome is caused by mutations in the GHR gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called the growth hormone receptor. The receptor is present on the outer membrane of cells throughout the body, particularly liver cells. As its name suggests, the growth hormone receptor attaches (binds) to growth hormone; the two proteins fit together like a key in a lock. When growth hormone is bound to its receptor, it triggers signaling that stimulates the growth and division of cells. This signaling also leads to the production, primarily by liver cells, of another important growth-promoting hormone called insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I).  Growth hormone and IGF-I have a wide variety of effects on the growth and function of many parts of the body. For example, these hormones stimulate the growth and division of cells called chondrocytes, which play a critical role in producing new bone tissue. Growth hormone and IGF-I also influence metabolism, including how the body uses and stores carbohydrates, proteins, and fats from food.  Mutations in the GHR gene impair the receptor's ability to bind to growth hormone or to trigger signaling within cells. As a result, even when growth hormone is available, cells are unable to respond by producing IGF-I and stimulating growth and division. The cells' inability to react to growth hormone, which is described as growth hormone insensitivity, disrupts the normal growth and function of many different tissues. Short stature results when growth hormone cannot adequately stimulate the growth of bones. Changes in metabolism caused by insensitivity to growth hormone and the resulting shortage of IGF-I cause many of the other features of the condition, including obesity.  Researchers are working to determine how mutations in the GHR gene may protect people with Laron syndrome from developing cancer and type 2 diabetes. Studies suggest that insensitivity to growth hormone may help prevent the uncontrolled growth and division of cells that can lead to the development of cancerous tumors. Growth hormone insensitivity also appears to alter how the body responds to insulin, which is a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. Resistance to the effects of insulin is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes. People with Laron syndrome have the opposite situation, an increased sensitivity to insulin, which likely helps explain their reduced risk of this common disease.";Laron syndrome, also known as growth hormone insensitivity syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by resistance to growth hormone (GH). The primary genetic change associated with Laron syndrome lies in the mutations of the growth hormone receptor (GHR) gene. These mutations can be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning that both copies of the GHR gene must carry the mutation for the disorder to manifest. The GHR gene provides instructions for making the growth hormone receptor, a protein that binds to GH and initiates intracellular signaling pathways crucial for growth and development. Mutations in the GHR gene can lead to a non-functional or truncated growth hormone receptor, resulting in impaired GH signaling and subsequent growth hormone resistance. This disruption in GH signaling affects various physiological processes, leading to the characteristic features of Laron syndrome, including short stature, delayed puberty, and impaired glucose metabolism.;0.027;349.0;131.0;0.31;0.109;0.183;0.809;0.047;-0.066;0.161
556;gemini-pro;causes;What causes Adenoameloblastoma ?;What causes adenoameloblastoma? Currently the cause of adenoameloblastoma is not well understood. It may be associated with an interruption in tooth development. These legions tend to occur more commonly in young people (around 20 year-old), and most often in young women. Adenoameloblastomas in the front upper jaw are often associated with an impacted tooth.;The exact cause of Adenoameloblastoma, a rare odontogenic tumor, remains unknown, but several factors have been implicated in its development. Genetic predisposition, alterations in specific genes like CTNNB1 and APC, mutations in the Wnt signaling pathway, and dysregulation of cell growth and differentiation processes are believed to play a role. Additionally, some studies suggest that hormonal influences, particularly during development and puberty, may contribute to the formation of Adenoameloblastoma.

Treatment typically depends on the heart or physical problems the person may have in addition to dextrocardia with situs inversus. For example, infants born with congenital heart defects or other organ malformations may require surgery. The management of people affected by Kartagener syndrome typically includes measures to enhance clearance of mucus, prevent respiratory infections, and treat bacterial infections.

In most cases, no specific treatment is necessary as the condition is usually asymptomatic. However, if the heart is significantly displaced or rotated, surgery may be required to correct the position of the heart and improve its function. Additionally, if there are associated medical problems, such as congenital heart defects or respiratory issues, these will need to be addressed with appropriate medical or surgical interventions.

558;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to juvenile idiopathic arthritis ?;"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is thought to arise from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The term ""idiopathic"" indicates that the specific cause of the disorder is unknown. Its signs and symptoms result from excessive inflammation in and around the joints. Inflammation occurs when the immune system sends signaling molecules and white blood cells to a site of injury or disease to fight microbial invaders and facilitate tissue repair. Normally, the body stops the inflammatory response after healing is complete to prevent damage to its own cells and tissues. In people with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, the inflammatory response is prolonged, particularly during movement of the joints. The reasons for this excessive inflammatory response are unclear.  Researchers have identified changes in several genes that may influence the risk of developing juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Many of these genes belong to a family of genes that provide instructions for making a group of related proteins called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). Each HLA gene has many different normal variations, allowing each person's immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins. Certain normal variations of several HLA genes seem to affect the risk of developing juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and the specific type of the condition that a person may have.  Normal variations in several other genes have also been associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Many of these genes are thought to play roles in immune system function. Additional unknown genetic influences and environmental factors, such as infection and other issues that affect immune health, are also likely to influence a person's chances of developing this complex disorder.";Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the joints that affects children under the age of 16. The exact cause of JIA is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Several genetic changes have been identified that are associated with JIA, including variations in genes involved in the immune system, such as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, and genes involved in bone and cartilage development. These genetic changes can make individuals more susceptible to developing JIA when triggered by environmental factors such as infections or stress.;0.028;265.0;92.0;0.406;0.138;0.203;0.827;0.127;0.011;0.246
559;gemini-pro;treatment;What are the treatments for Situs inversus ?;How might situs inversus be treated? In isolated situs inversus, no treatment may be necessary. When situs inversus is associated with another condition, treatment may depend on the associated condition and the signs and symptoms present in the affected person. Knowing that a person has situs inversus is important for diagnosing medical problems and preventing surgical mishaps that can result from the failure to recognize reversed anatomy. For example, in a person with situs inversus, appendicitis causes pain in the left lower abdomen instead of the right lower abdomen. Wearing medical identification can help ensure proper treatment in an emergency medical situation.;Treatment for situs inversus is generally not necessary as the condition itself does not cause any health problems. However, if there are associated medical conditions, such as heart defects or respiratory issues, treatment will be directed at those specific conditions. This may involve medications, surgery, or other therapies.

560;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency ?;Mutations in the DLD gene cause dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD). DLD is one component of three different groups of enzymes that work together (enzyme complexes): branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKD), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), and alpha ()-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH). The BCKD enzyme complex is involved in the breakdown of three protein building blocks (amino acids) commonly found in protein-rich foods: leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Breakdown of these amino acids produces molecules that can be used for energy. The PDH and KGDH enzyme complexes are involved in other reactions in the pathways that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use.  Mutations in the DLD gene impair the function of the DLD enzyme, which prevents the three enzyme complexes from functioning properly. As a result, molecules that are normally broken down and their byproducts build up in the body, damaging tissues and leading to lactic acidosis and other chemical imbalances. In addition, the production of cellular energy is diminished. The brain is especially affected by the buildup of molecules and the lack of cellular energy, resulting in the neurological problems associated with dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency. Liver problems are likely also related to decreased energy production in cells. The degree of impairment of each complex contributes to the variability in the features of this condition.;Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) deficiency is a rare inherited disorder caused by mutations in the DLD gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, which is involved in several important chemical reactions in the body, including the metabolism of glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids. Mutations in the DLD gene can lead to a deficiency of this enzyme, resulting in a buildup of toxic substances in the body and damage to various tissues and organs. These mutations can disrupt the enzyme's structure or function, leading to impaired activity and a range of clinical manifestations, including seizures, developmental delay, intellectual disability, movement disorders, and cardiomyopathy.

Decisions on treatment of infections with Acinetobacter should be made on a case-by-case basis by a healthcare provider. Acinetobacter infection typically occurs in ill patients and can either cause or contribute to death in these patients.;Acinetobacter, a Gram-negative bacteria, is a common cause of healthcare-associated infections, particularly in immuno compromised patients. Treatment options include combination antibiotic therapy targeting the organism's resistance mechanisms, such as carbapenem antibiotics (imipenem, meropenem), fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin), and aminoglycosides (gentamicin, amikacin). In cases of multidrug resistance, tigecycline or colistin may be considered. Infection control measures, including proper hand hygiene, isolation of infected patients, and environmental cleaning and disinfection, are crucial in preventing the spread of infection. Antimicrobial stewardship programs, aimed at optimizing antibiotic use and reducing resistance, are also essential in managing Acinetobacter infections in healthcare settings.;0.013;43.0;92.0;0.252;0.015;0.126;0.714;-0.075;0.155;-0.288

A doctor will perform a physical exam and ask questions about your childs bowel movements. HD is much less likely if parents can identify a time when their childs bowel habits were normal.
                
If HD is suspected, the doctor will do one or more tests.
                
X rays
                
An x ray is a black-and-white picture of the inside of the body. To make the large intestine show up better, the doctor may fill it with barium liquid. Barium liquid is inserted into the large intestine through the anus.
                
If HD is the problem, the last segment of the large intestine will look narrower than normal. Just before this narrow segment, the intestine will look bulged. The bulging is caused by blocked stool stretching the intestine.
                
Manometry
                
During manometry, the doctor inflates a small balloon inside the rectum. Normally, the rectal muscles will relax. If the muscles dont relax, HD may be the problem. This test is most often done in older children and adults.
                
Biopsy
                
Biopsy is the most accurate test for HD. The doctor removes a tiny piece of the large intestine and looks at it with a microscope. If nerve cells are missing, HD is the problem.";Hirschsprung Disease is diagnosed by a combination of clinical evaluation, imaging studies, and biopsies. Clinical evaluation includes a detailed medical history and physical examination, paying attention to signs and symptoms such as constipation, abdominal distension, and failure to pass stool within 48 hours after birth. Imaging studies, such as X-rays and barium enemas, can help visualize the affected segment of the colon and assess its length and location. Biopsies are taken from the affected and unaffected segments of the colon to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions with similar symptoms. Genetic testing may also be performed to identify any underlying genetic mutations that contribute to the disease.;0.007;177.0;101.0;0.18;0.016;0.095;0.527;-0.057;-0.09;-0.026

The MTM1 gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called myotubularin. Myotubularin is thought to be involved in the development and maintenance of muscle cells.  MTM1 gene mutations probably disrupt myotubularin's role in muscle cell development and maintenance, causing muscle weakness and other signs and symptoms of X-linked myotubular myopathy.;X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is caused by mutations in the MTM1 gene, which encodes the protein myotubularin. Myotubularin is a lipid phosphatase that plays a crucial role in the formation and function of endosomes and lysosomes, cellular compartments involved in membrane trafficking and degradation of cellular waste. Mutations in the MTM1 gene can lead to the absence or dysfunction of myotubularin, resulting in the accumulation of abnormal endosomes and lysosomes, impaired autophagy, and disruption of cellular homeostasis. These genetic changes ultimately cause the muscle weakness and wasting characteristic of XLMTM, particularly affecting skeletal muscles, leading to difficulties with movement, breathing, and swallowing.;0.069;55.0;93.0;0.333;0.164;0.255;0.788;0.256;0.377;0.138

This gene provides instructions for making a protein called glypican 3, which is involved in the regulation of cell growth and division (cell proliferation). Researchers believe that the GPC3 protein can also cause certain cells to self-destruct (undergo apoptosis) when they are no longer needed, which can help establish the body's shape.  GPC3 mutations can delete part or all of the gene, or alter the structure of glypican 3. These mutations prevent the protein from performing its usual functions, which may contribute to an increased rate of cell growth and cell division starting before birth. It is unclear, however, how a shortage of functional glypican 3 causes overgrowth of the entire body and the other abnormalities characteristic of Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome.  Some individuals with Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome do not have identified mutations in the GPC3 gene. In these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown.;Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the GPC3 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called glypican-3, which is involved in cell division and growth. Mutations in the GPC3 gene lead to the production of a nonfunctional glypican-3 protein, which disrupts normal cell growth and development. As a result, individuals with SGBS experience a range of symptoms, including overgrowth, distinctive facial features, skeletal abnormalities, and intellectual disability.;0.086;142.0;67.0;0.366;0.187;0.296;0.828;0.234;0.135;0.334

Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk.   Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor may be linked to changes in the tumor suppressor genes SMARCB1 or SMARCA4. Genes of this type make a protein that helps control cell growth. Changes in the DNA of tumor suppressor genes like SMARCB1 or SMARCA4 may lead to cancer.   Changes in the SMARCB1 or SMARCA4 genes may be inherited (passed on from parents to offspring). When this gene change is inherited, tumors may form in two parts of the body at the same time (for example, in the brain and the kidney). For patients with AT/RT, genetic counseling (a discussion with a trained professional about inherited diseases and a possible need for gene testing) may be recommended.";Childhood Central Nervous System Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor (CNS ATRT) is a rare and aggressive brain tumor that primarily affects young children. The exact cause of CNS ATRT is unknown, but certain factors may increase the risk of developing the disease. Children with germline mutations in the SMARCB1 gene, which encodes a protein involved in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation, are at an increased risk of developing CNS ATRT. Additionally, children with specific genetic syndromes, such as Coffin-Siris syndrome and Diamond-Blackfan anemia, have a higher risk of developing CNS ATRT. Furthermore, infants born with low birth weight or those who have experienced intrauterine growth restriction may also be at an increased risk of developing the disease.;0.034;159.0;106.0;0.325;0.07;0.193;0.703;-0.029;-0.021;-0.04
568;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to primary sclerosing cholangitis ?;Primary sclerosing cholangitis is thought to arise from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Researchers believe that genetic changes play a role in this condition because it often occurs in several members of a family and because immediate family members of someone with primary sclerosing cholangitis have an increased risk of developing the condition. It is likely that specific genetic variations increase a person's risk of developing primary sclerosing cholangitis, and then exposure to certain environmental factors triggers the disorder. However, the genetic changes that increase susceptibility and the environmental triggers remain unclear.  There is evidence that variations in certain genes involved in immune function influence the risk of developing primary sclerosing cholangitis. The most commonly associated genes belong to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). Each HLA gene has many different normal variations, allowing each person's immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins. Specific variations of several HLA genes seem to be present more often in people with primary sclerosing cholangitis than in people who do not have the disorder. These variations may dysregulate the body's immune response, leading to the inflammation of the bile ducts in people with primary sclerosing cholangitis. However, the mechanism is not well understood. Researchers are also studying variations in other genes related to the body's immune function to understand how they contribute to the risk of developing this condition.;Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is an autoimmune liver disease characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrosis of the bile ducts. The exact cause of PSC is unknown, but genetic factors are believed to play a role. Genome-wide association studies have identified several genetic variants associated with PSC, including variations in the HLA region, which is involved in immune regulation, and the NOD2 gene, which is involved in innate immunity. Additionally, mutations in genes encoding transporter proteins, such as ABCB4 and ABCB11, have been associated with PSC. These genetic changes may contribute to the development of PSC by altering immune responses, disrupting bile flow, and promoting inflammation and fibrosis in the bile ducts.;0.015;235.0;103.0;0.354;0.075;0.219;0.754;0.089;0.031;0.144
569;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis ?;Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a neurological condition in which amyloid protein is deposited onto the walls of the arteries of the brain (and less frequently, veins).  Although CAA often does not cause symptoms, it may cause bleeding into the brain (hemorrhagic stroke), dementia, or neurologic episodes in some patients.  The majority of CAA cases occur in individuals who do not have a family history. However, two familial forms of CAA have been identified.;Hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis (HCHWA) is a rare genetic condition characterized by the accumulation of amyloid proteins in the walls of blood vessels in the brain. These amyloid deposits weaken the blood vessel walls, making them prone to rupture and causing hemorrhages (bleeding) in the brain. HCHWA is typically caused by mutations in the cystatin C (CST3) gene, which provides instructions for making a protein involved in the regulation of amyloid proteins. The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that only one copy of the mutated gene is needed for the condition to develop. Symptoms of HCHWA can vary depending on the location and extent of the hemorrhages, but may include headache, seizures, cognitive impairment, and difficulty with movement and coordination. Treatment options for HCHWA are limited, but may include supportive care, medications to manage symptoms, and in some cases, surgical intervention to remove the amyloid deposits.;0.012;67.0;135.0;0.224;0.021;0.14;0.596;0.05;0.135;-0.036
570;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to retinal arterial macroaneurysm with supravalvular pulmonic stenosis ?;RAMSVPS is caused by a mutation in the IGFBP7 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP7). The IGFBP7 protein is active in the lining of blood vessels (the vascular endothelium). It is thought to help stop a pathway called BRAF signaling, which is involved in directing cell growth.  The IGFBP7 gene mutation that causes RAMSVPS results in an abnormally short IGFBP7 protein that does not function properly. Without normally functioning IGFBP7 protein to control BRAF signaling, this signaling is increased. It is unknown how this increase is related to the specific blood vessel abnormalities that occur in RAMSVPS, or why these abnormalities are confined to the eyes and the pulmonary artery. Researchers suggest that differences in normal levels of IGFBP7 protein in various parts of the body or the presence of other proteins with a similar function in different tissues may account for the specific signs and symptoms of this disorder.;Retinal arterial macroaneurysm with supravalvular pulmonic stenosis (RAM-SVPS) is a rare disease characterized by the development of macroaneurysms in the retinal arteries and supravalvular pulmonic stenosis. The genetic basis of RAM-SVPS is complex and involves mutations in multiple genes, including ELN, TGFBR2, and SMAD9. Mutations in ELN, which encodes elastin, are the most commonly identified genetic abnormality in RAM-SVPS. Elastin is a key component of the extracellular matrix and plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of blood vessels. Mutations in TGFBR2 and SMAD9, which encode components of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway, have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of RAM-SVPS. The TGF-β signaling pathway is involved in regulating cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, and mutations in these genes can lead to abnormal vascular development and increased susceptibility to aneurysm formation.;0.028;144.0;125.0;0.238;0.056;0.179;0.672;0.012;0.061;-0.04

572;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Hypoglycemia ?;Hypoglycemia means low blood glucose, or blood sugar. Your body needs glucose to have enough energy. After you eat, your blood absorbs glucose. If you eat more sugar than your body needs, your muscles, and liver store the extra. When your blood sugar begins to fall, a hormone tells your liver to release glucose.    In most people, this raises blood sugar. If it doesn't, you have hypoglycemia, and your blood sugar can be dangerously low. Signs include        - Hunger    - Shakiness    - Dizziness    - Confusion    - Difficulty speaking    - Feeling anxious or weak       In people with diabetes, hypoglycemia is often a side effect of diabetes medicines. Eating or drinking something with carbohydrates can help. If it happens often, your health care provider may need to change your treatment plan.    You can also have low blood sugar without having diabetes. Causes include certain medicines or diseases, hormone or enzyme deficiencies, and tumors. Laboratory tests can help find the cause. The kind of treatment depends on why you have low blood sugar.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases;Hypoglycemia is a condition in which the blood sugar (glucose) level falls too low. Glucose is the body's main source of energy, and without it, the body cannot function properly. Hypoglycemia can be caused by a variety of factors, including not eating enough, taking too much insulin or other diabetes medications, drinking too much alcohol, and exercising too much. Symptoms of hypoglycemia can include sweating, shaking, hunger, dizziness, confusion, and seizures. If left untreated, hypoglycemia can lead to loss of consciousness, coma, and even death. Treatment for hypoglycemia typically involves eating or drinking something that contains sugar.;0.023;169.0;92.0;0.337;0.059;0.169;0.779;0.085;0.021;0.147

                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.";"Clinical trials are exploring various treatment strategies for hypopharyngeal cancer, such as:

579;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to Maffucci syndrome ?;In most people with Maffucci syndrome, the disorder is caused by mutations in the IDH1 or IDH2 gene. These genes provide instructions for making enzymes called isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2, respectively. These enzymes convert a compound called isocitrate to another compound called 2-ketoglutarate. This reaction also produces a molecule called NADPH, which is necessary for many cellular processes. IDH1 or IDH2 gene mutations cause the enzyme produced from the respective gene to take on a new, abnormal function.

580;gemini-pro;information;Do you have information about Ultrasound;Summary : Ultrasound is a type of imaging. It uses high-frequency sound waves to look at organs and structures inside the body. Health care professionals use it to view the heart, blood vessels, kidneys, liver, and other organs. During pregnancy, doctors use ultrasound to view the fetus. Unlike x-rays, ultrasound does not expose you to radiation.    During an ultrasound test, you lie on a table. A special technician or doctor moves a device called a transducer over part of your body. The transducer sends out sound waves, which bounce off the tissues inside your body. The transducer also captures the waves that bounce back. The ultrasound machine creates images from the sound waves.;Ultrasound, also known as sonography, is a non-invasive medical imaging technique that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce real-time images of the body's internal organs, tissues, and blood vessels. It utilizes a transducer to emit sound waves into the body, which bounce off tissues and structures and return to the transducer. The reflected sound waves are then processed and converted into images that can be viewed on a monitor. Ultrasound is commonly used for various medical purposes, including prenatal imaging, abdominal and pelvic organ evaluation, cardiac assessments, vascular studies, and musculoskeletal examinations. It is a versatile and widely accessible imaging modality due to its safety, portability, and ability to provide real-time visualization of body structures.;0.086;97.0;107.0;0.342;0.103;0.247;0.79;0.152;0.191;0.11
581;gemini-pro;treatment;What are the treatments for Angina ?;"Treatments for angina include lifestyle changes, medicines, medical procedures, cardiac rehabilitation (rehab), and other therapies. The main goals of treatment are to:
                
Reduce pain and discomfort and how often it occurs
                
Prevent or lower your risk for heart attack and death by treating your underlying heart condition
                
Lifestyle changes and medicines may be the only treatments needed if your symptoms are mild and aren't getting worse. If lifestyle changes and medicines don't control angina, you may need medical procedures or cardiac rehab.
                
Unstable angina is an emergency condition that requires treatment in a hospital.
                
Lifestyle Changes
                
Making lifestyle changes can help prevent episodes of angina. You can:
                
Slow down or take rest breaks if physical exertion triggers angina.
                
Avoid large meals and rich foods that leave you feeling stuffed if heavy meals trigger angina.
                
Try to avoid situations that make you upset or stressed if emotional stress triggers angina. Learn ways to handle stress that can't be avoided.
                
You also can make lifestyle changes that help lower your risk for coronary heart disease. One of the most important changes is to quit smoking. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels and raise your risk for CHD. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.
                
If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.
                
For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index (DCI) Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBIs) ""Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.""
                
Following a healthy diet is another important lifestyle change. A healthy diet can prevent or reduce high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol and help you maintain a healthy weight.
                
A healthy diet includes a variety of fruits and vegetables (including beans and peas). It also includes whole grains, lean meats, poultry without skin, seafood, and fat-free or low-fat milk and dairy products. A healthy diet also is low in sodium (salt), added sugars, solid fats, and refined grains.

Other important lifestyle changes include:
                
Being physically active. Check with your doctor to find out how much and what kinds of activity are safe for you. For more information, go to the DCI Physical Activity and Your Heart article.
                
Maintaining a healthy weight. If youre overweight or obese, work with your doctor to create a reasonable weight-loss plan. Controlling your weight helps you control CHD risk factors.
                
Taking all medicines as your doctor prescribes, especially if you have diabetes.
                
Medicines
                
Nitrates are the medicines most commonly used to treat angina. They relax and widen blood vessels. This allows more blood to flow to the heart, while reducing the hearts workload.
                
Nitroglycerin (NI-tro-GLIS-er-in) is the most commonly used nitrate for angina. Nitroglycerin that dissolves under your tongue or between your cheek and gum is used to relieve angina episodes.
                
Nitroglycerin pills and skin patches are used to prevent angina episodes. However, pills and skin patches act too slowly to relieve pain during an angina attack.
                
Other medicines also are used to treat angina, such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, oral antiplatelet medicines, or anticoagulants (blood thinners). These medicines can help:
                
Lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels
                
Slow the heart rate
                
Relax blood vessels
                
Reduce strain on the heart
                
Prevent blood clots from forming
                
People who have stable angina may be advised to get annual flu shots.
                
Medical Procedures
                
If lifestyle changes and medicines don't control angina, you may need a medical procedure to treat the underlying heart disease. Both angioplasty (AN-jee-oh-plas-tee) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are commonly used to treat heart disease.
                
Angioplasty opens blocked or narrowed coronary arteries. During angioplasty, a thin tube with a balloon or other device on the end is threaded through a blood vessel to the narrowed or blocked coronary artery.
                
Once in place, the balloon is inflated to push the plaque outward against the wall of the artery. This widens the artery and restores blood flow.
                
Angioplasty can improve blood flow to your heart and relieve chest pain. A small mesh tube called a stent usually is placed in the artery to help keep it open after the procedure.
                
During CABG, healthy arteries or veins taken from other areas in your body are used to bypass (that is, go around) your narrowed coronary arteries. Bypass surgery can improve blood flow to your heart, relieve chest pain, and possibly prevent a heart attack.
                
You will work with your doctor to decide which treatment is better for you.
                
Cardiac Rehabilitation
                
Your doctor may recommend cardiac rehab for angina or after angioplasty, CABG, or a heart attack. Cardiac rehab is a medically supervised program that can help improve the health and well-being of people who have heart problems.
                
The cardiac rehab team may include doctors, nurses, exercise specialists, physical and occupational therapists, dietitians or nutritionists, and psychologists or other mental health specialists.
                
Rehab has two parts:
                
Exercise training. This part helps you learn how to exercise safely, strengthen your muscles, and improve your stamina. Your exercise plan will be based on your personal abilities, needs, and interests.
                
Education, counseling, and training. This part of rehab helps you understand your heart condition and find ways to reduce your risk for future heart problems. The rehab team will help you learn how to adjust to a new lifestyle and deal with your fears about the future.
                
For more information about cardiac rehab, go to the DCI Cardiac Rehabilitation article.
                
Enhanced External Counterpulsation Therapy
                
Enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) therapy is helpful for some people who have angina. Large cuffs, similar to blood pressure cuffs, are put on your legs. The cuffs are inflated and deflated in sync with your heartbeat.
                
EECP therapy improves the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle and helps relieve angina. You typically get 35 1-hour treatments over 7 weeks.";Angina, a type of chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart, can be managed through various treatments. Medications like nitrates, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers help improve blood flow and reduce chest pain. Additionally, lifestyle changes, including adopting a heart-healthy diet, regular exercise, managing stress, and quitting smoking, can help alleviate symptoms. In severe cases, procedures such as angioplasty or bypass surgery may be necessary to improve blood flow to the heart.;0.0;979.0;71.0;0.173;0.034;0.102;0.682;-0.145;-0.329;0.05
582;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) porphyria ?;"Porphyria is a group of disorders caused by abnormalities in the chemical steps that lead to heme production. Heme is a vital molecule for all of the body's organs, although it is most abundant in the blood, bone marrow, and liver. Heme is a component of several iron-containing proteins called hemoproteins, including hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen in the blood).  Researchers have identified several types of porphyria, which are distinguished by their genetic cause and their signs and symptoms. Some types of porphyria, called cutaneous porphyrias, primarily affect the skin. Areas of skin exposed to the sun become fragile and blistered, which can lead to infection, scarring, changes in skin coloring (pigmentation), and increased hair growth. Cutaneous porphyrias include congenital erythropoietic porphyria, erythropoietic protoporphyria, hepatoerythropoietic porphyria, and porphyria cutanea tarda.  Other types of porphyria, called acute porphyrias, primarily affect the nervous system. These disorders are described as ""acute"" because their signs and symptoms appear quickly and usually last a short time. Episodes of acute porphyria can cause abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, and diarrhea. During an episode, a person may also experience muscle weakness, seizures, fever, and mental changes such as anxiety and hallucinations. These signs and symptoms can be life-threatening, especially if the muscles that control breathing become paralyzed. Acute porphyrias include acute intermittent porphyria and ALAD deficiency porphyria. Two other forms of porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria and variegate porphyria, can have both acute and cutaneous symptoms.  The porphyrias can also be split into erythropoietic and hepatic types, depending on where damaging compounds called porphyrins and porphyrin precursors first build up in the body. In erythropoietic porphyrias, these compounds originate in the bone marrow. Erythropoietic porphyrias include erythropoietic protoporphyria and congenital erythropoietic porphyria. Health problems associated with erythropoietic porphyrias include a low number of red blood cells (anemia) and enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly). The other types of porphyrias are considered hepatic porphyrias. In these disorders, porphyrins and porphyrin precursors originate primarily in the liver, leading to abnormal liver function and an increased risk of developing liver cancer.  Environmental factors can strongly influence the occurrence and severity of signs and symptoms of porphyria. Alcohol, smoking, certain drugs, hormones, other illnesses, stress, and dieting or periods without food (fasting) can all trigger the signs and symptoms of some forms of the disorder. Additionally, exposure to sunlight worsens the skin damage in people with cutaneous porphyrias.";Porphyria is a group of inherited metabolic disorders that affect the production of heme, an essential component of hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying molecule in red blood cells. This results in the accumulation of porphyrins, which are intermediates in the heme biosynthetic pathway, in the body. Porphyrias are classified based on the specific enzyme deficiency or defect in the heme biosynthetic pathway, and they can manifest with a wide range of symptoms, including skin photosensitivity, abdominal pain, neurological disturbances, and psychiatric manifestations. Depending on the type of porphyria, symptoms can vary significantly, ranging from mild to life-threatening. Treatment typically involves avoiding triggers, such as certain medications and dietary restrictions, as well as symptomatic management and, in some cases, specific therapies.;0.006;367.0;107.0;0.282;0.066;0.159;0.809;-0.049;-0.235;0.148
583;gemini-pro;outlook;What is the outlook for Tropical Spastic Paraparesis ?;HAM/TSP is a progressive disease, but it is rarely fatal. Most individuals live for several decades after the diagnosis. Their prognosis improves if they take steps to prevent urinary tract infection and skin sores, and if they participate in physical and occupational therapy programs.;The outlook for Tropical Spastic Paraparesis (TSP) can vary depending on the severity of the condition and the individual's overall health. In general, TSP progresses slowly, with symptoms gradually worsening over time. The rate of progression can be influenced by factors such as the underlying cause, the age of onset, and the presence of other medical conditions. While there is currently no cure for TSP, treatments can help manage the symptoms and improve quality of life. These treatments may include physical therapy, occupational therapy, medications, and assistive devices. In some cases, surgery may be an option to address certain complications. Early diagnosis and intervention can help slow the progression of the disease and optimize outcomes. Regular monitoring and ongoing care are essential to managing TSP and providing the best possible support to individuals affected by this condition.;0.009;42.0;124.0;0.171;0.012;0.078;0.362;-0.051;0.011;-0.115
584;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is warfarin resistance inherited ?;The polymorphisms associated with this condition are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to result in warfarin resistance. However, different polymorphisms affect the activity of warfarin to varying degrees. Additionally, people who have more than one polymorphism in a gene or polymorphisms in multiple genes associated with warfarin resistance have a higher tolerance for the drug's effect or are able to process the drug more quickly.;Warfarin resistance, a condition where individuals exhibit reduced sensitivity to the anticoagulant drug warfarin, can have both inherited and acquired components. Genetic variations in specific genes encoding enzymes involved in warfarin metabolism, primarily CYP2C9 and VKORC1, can influence warfarin's anticoagulant effect, with certain variants leading to resistance. These genetic variations are inherited from both parents, and individuals with specific combinations of these variants may require adjusted warfarin dosages to achieve the desired anticoagulant response. However, acquired factors, such as drug interactions, dietary changes, and certain medical conditions, can also contribute to warfarin resistance, emphasizing the need for personalized dosing and careful monitoring during warfarin therapy.;0.018;71.0;101.0;0.248;0.036;0.132;0.783;0.118;0.156;0.079

586;gemini-pro;symptoms;What are the symptoms of Omenn syndrome ?;What are the signs and symptoms of Omenn syndrome? Infants with Omenn syndrome typically present shortly after birth, usually by 3 months of age. This is similar to other types of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). The characteristic skin findings (red and peeling skin), chronic diarrhea, and failure to thrive often precede the onset of infections. Life-threatening infections caused by common viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens occur next. Lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly, both symptoms unique to Omenn syndrome, develop next. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Omenn syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.;Omenn syndrome, a rare and severe combined immunodeficiency disorder caused by mutations in the RAG1 or RAG2 genes, manifests with various symptoms. Infants with Omenn syndrome typically present with recurrent, severe infections involving multiple organ systems, including pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis, due to an inability to produce functional T cells and B cells. Additional symptoms can include chronic diarrhea, failure to thrive, enlarged lymph nodes and spleen, skin rashes, eczema, and an increased risk of autoimmune disorders and malignancy. Affected individuals may also exhibit dysmorphic features such as microcephaly, prominent ears, and a small jaw. The severity of Omenn syndrome varies, with some infants experiencing a fulminant course leading to early death, while others may have a more protracted clinical course.;0.012;353.0;113.0;0.239;0.061;0.13;0.705;-0.218;-0.385;-0.042
587;gemini-pro;exams and tests;How to diagnose Wilson Disease ?;"A health care provider may use several tests and exams to diagnose Wilson disease, including the following:
                
- medical and family history  - physical exam  - blood tests  - urine tests  - liver biopsy  - imaging tests
                
Health care providers typically see the same symptoms of Wilson disease in other conditions, and the symptoms of Wilson disease do not occur together often, making the disease difficult to diagnose.
                
Medical and Family History
                
A health care provider may take a medical and family history to help diagnose Wilson disease.
                
Physical Exam
                
A physical exam may help diagnose Wilson disease. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually
                
- examines a patients body  - uses a stethoscope to listen to sounds related to the abdomen
                
A health care provider will use a special light called a slit lamp to look for Kayser-Fleischer rings in the eyes.
                
Blood Tests
                
A nurse or technician will draw blood samples at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and send the samples to a lab for analysis. A health care provider may
                
- perform liver enzyme or function testsblood tests that may indicate liver abnormalities.  - check copper levels in the blood. Since the copper is deposited into the organs and is not circulating in the blood, most people with Wilson disease have a lower-than-normal level of copper in the blood. In cases of acute liver failure caused by Wilson disease, the level of blood copper is often higher than normal.  - check the level of ceruloplasmina protein that carries copper in the bloodstream. Most people with Wilson disease have a lower-than-normal ceruloplasmin level.  - conduct genetic testing. A health care provider may recommend genetic testing in cases of a known family history of Wilson disease.
                
Urine Tests
                
24-hour urine collection. A patient will collect urine at home in a special container provided by a health care providers office or a commercial facility. A health care provider sends the sample to a lab for analysis. A 24-hour urine collection will show increased copper in the urine in most patients who have symptoms due to Wilson disease.
                
Liver Biopsy
                
A liver biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a small piece of liver tissue for examination with a microscope for signs of damage or disease. The health care provider may ask the patient to stop taking certain medications temporarily before the liver biopsy. He or she may also ask the patient to fasteat or drink nothingfor 8 hours before the procedure.
                
During the procedure, the patient lies on a table, right hand resting above the head. The health care provider applies a local anesthetic to the area where he or she will insert the biopsy needle. If needed, a health care provider will also give sedatives and pain medication. The health care provider uses the needle to take a small piece of liver tissue. He or she may use ultrasound, computerized tomography scans, or other imaging techniques to guide the needle. After the biopsy, the patient must lie on the right side for up to 2 hours and is monitored an additional 2 to 4 hours before being sent home.
                
A pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseasesexamines the liver tissue in a lab. The test can show cirrhosis of the liver. Sometimes the liver biopsy will show copper buildup in the liver cells; however, the results can vary because the copper does not always deposit evenly into the liver. Therefore, health care providers often find it more useful to analyze a piece of liver tissue for copper content. Most patients with Wilson disease have high levels of copper in the liver tissue when compared with carriers or with people who do not have Wilson disease.
                
More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Liver Biopsy.
                
Imaging Tests
                
A health care provider may order imaging tests to evaluate brain abnormalities in patients who have nervous system symptoms often seen with Wilson disease, or in patients diagnosed with Wilson disease. Health care providers do not use brain imaging tests to diagnose Wilson disease, though certain findings may suggest the patient has the disease.
                
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI is a test that takes pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. The patient does not need anesthesia, though people with a fear of confined spaces may receive light sedation, taken by mouth. An MRI may include the injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. With most MRI machines, the patient will lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end. Some machines allow the patient to lie in a more open space. The technician will take a sequence of images from different angles to create a detailed picture of the brain. During sequencing, the patient will hear loud mechanical knocking and humming noises. MRI can show if other diseases or conditions are causing the patients neurological symptoms.
                
Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan uses a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. For a CT scan, a health care provider may give the patient a solution to drink and an injection of contrast medium. CT scans require the patient to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where a technician takes the x rays. An x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital. A radiologist interprets the images. The patient does not need anesthesia. A CT scan can show if other diseases or conditions are causing the patients neurological symptoms.";Wilson disease is diagnosed through a combination of blood tests, urine tests, liver biopsy, and genetic testing. Blood tests measure levels of copper and ceruloplasmin, a protein that binds to copper. Urine tests measure the amount of copper excreted in the urine. A liver biopsy can show signs of copper accumulation and damage to the liver. Genetic testing can identify mutations in the ATP7B gene, which is responsible for copper metabolism. A definitive diagnosis of Wilson disease requires the presence of both high levels of copper in the liver and a mutation in the ATP7B gene.;0.0;816.0;84.0;0.15;0.058;0.106;0.758;-0.07;-0.244;0.113

589;gemini-pro;causes;What causes Biliary Atresia ?;"Biliary atresia likely has multiple causes, though none are yet proven. Biliary atresia is not an inherited disease, meaning it does not pass from parent to child. Therefore, survivors of biliary atresia are not at risk for passing the disorder to their children.
                
Biliary atresia is most likely caused by an event in the womb or around the time of birth. Possible triggers of the event may include one or more of the following:
                
- a viral or bacterial infection after birth, such as cytomegalovirus, reovirus, or rotavirus  - an immune system problem, such as when the immune system attacks the liver or bile ducts for unknown reasons  - a genetic mutation, which is a permanent change in a genes structure  - a problem during liver and bile duct development in the womb  - exposure to toxic substances";Biliary atresia is a rare condition in which the bile ducts that carry bile from the liver to the gallbladder and small intestine are damaged or absent. This can lead to a buildup of bile in the liver, causing liver damage and eventually liver failure. The exact cause of biliary atresia is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some of the risk factors for biliary atresia include being born prematurely, having a low birth weight, and having certain genetic conditions.;0.037;117.0;80.0;0.329;0.054;0.171;0.886;0.111;0.042;0.18

They are also helpful for other conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, and high cholesterol. Individuals with other medical conditions (diabetes, high blood pressure, or elevated cholesterol) should be treated with medication as advised by their physician. Some new treatment options are now being studied in clinical trials. These include the use of antioxidants (such as vitamin E, selenium, and betaine) and some newer antidiabetic medications (metformin, rosiglitazone, and pioglitazone) which treat insulin resistance.;Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) treatment primarily focuses on addressing the underlying cause and preventing further liver damage. The mainstays of management include lifestyle modifications, such as weight loss, regular exercise, and a balanced diet. Pharmacotherapy options may include medications to improve insulin sensitivity, reduce inflammation, and combat oxidative stress.

Hashimoto thyroiditis is classified as an autoimmune disorder, one of a large group of conditions that occur when the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs. In people with Hashimoto thyroiditis, white blood cells called lymphocytes accumulate abnormally in the thyroid, which can damage it. The lymphocytes make immune system proteins called antibodies that attack and destroy thyroid cells. When too many thyroid cells become damaged or die, the thyroid can no longer make enough hormones to regulate body functions. This shortage of thyroid hormones underlies the signs and symptoms of Hashimoto thyroiditis. However, some people with thyroid antibodies never develop hypothyroidism or experience any related signs or symptoms.  People with Hashimoto thyroiditis have an increased risk of developing other autoimmune disorders, including vitiligo, rheumatoid arthritis, Addison disease, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and pernicious anemia.  Variations in several genes have been studied as possible risk factors for Hashimoto thyroiditis. Some of these genes are part of a family called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). Other genes that have been associated with Hashimoto thyroiditis help regulate the immune system or are involved in normal thyroid function. Most of the genetic variations that have been discovered are thought to have a small impact on a person's overall risk of developing this condition.  Other, nongenetic factors also play a role in Hashimoto thyroiditis. These factors may trigger the condition in people who are at risk, although the mechanism is unclear. Potential triggers include changes in sex hormones (particularly in women), viral infections, certain medications, exposure to ionizing radiation, and excess consumption of iodine (a substance involved in thyroid hormone production).;"Hashimoto thyroiditis, also known as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, is an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of the thyroid gland. The genetic basis of Hashimoto thyroiditis is complex and involves multiple genetic changes, including:
- **HLA genes:** Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes are involved in the regulation of the immune system. Certain HLA alleles, such as HLA-DR3 and HLA-DR5, are strongly associated with an increased risk of developing Hashimoto thyroiditis.
- **Cytokine genes:** Cytokines are small proteins that play a role in regulating the immune response. Genetic variations in cytokine genes, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), have been associated with an increased risk of Hashimoto thyroiditis.
- **Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (TG) genes:** TPO and TG are proteins involved in the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Genetic variations in the TPO and TG genes have been linked to an increased risk of Hashimoto thyroiditis.
- **Other genes:** Other genes, including those involved in immune regulation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress, have also been implicated in the development of Hashimoto thyroiditis.";0.05;296.0;157.0;0.352;0.128;0.192;0.857;0.069;0.019;0.118
594;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Tendinitis ?;Tendons are flexible bands of tissue that connect muscles to bones. They help your muscles move your bones. Tendinitis is the severe swelling of a tendon.    Tendinitis usually happens after repeated injury to an area such as the wrist or ankle. It causes pain and soreness around a joint. Some common forms of tendinitis are named after the sports that increase their risk. They include tennis elbow, golfer's elbow, pitcher's shoulder, swimmer's shoulder, and jumper's knee.    Doctors diagnose tendinitis with your medical history, a physical exam, and imaging tests. The first step in treatment is to reduce pain and swelling. Rest, wrapping or elevating the affected area, and medicines can help. Ice is helpful for recent, severe injuries. Other treatments include ultrasound, physical therapy, steroid injections, and surgery.;"Tendinitis is the inflammation of a tendon, the thick fibrous cord that connects muscle to bone. It is a common condition that often affects the shoulder, elbow, wrist, knee, and Achilles tendon. Symptoms of tendinitis include pain, swelling, tenderness, and stiffness around the affected joint. Treatment for tendinitis typically involves rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE); physical therapy; and pain relievers. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary.";0.014;119.0;62.0;0.403;0.045;0.245;0.797;0.189;0.098;0.281
595;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Autoimmune Hepatitis ?;"Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronicor long lastingdisease in which the body's immune system attacks the normal components, or cells, of the liver and causes inflammation and liver damage. The immune system normally protects people from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances.
                
Autoimmune hepatitis is a serious condition that may worsen over time if not treated. Autoimmune hepatitis can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. Cirrhosis occurs when scar tissue replaces healthy liver tissue and blocks the normal flow of blood through the liver. Liver failure occurs when the liver stops working properly.";Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic inflammatory liver disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the liver cells, leading to inflammation and damage. The exact cause of AIH is unknown, but it is thought to be triggered by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. AIH can affect people of all ages and both genders, but it is more common in women and people between the ages of 15 and 40. Symptoms of AIH can range from mild, such as fatigue and loss of appetite, to severe, such as jaundice, abdominal pain, and swelling in the legs. Treatment for AIH typically involves immunosuppressive medications to suppress the immune system and prevent further liver damage.;0.058;90.0;108.0;0.292;0.077;0.234;0.775;0.096;0.128;0.061
596;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is Blau syndrome inherited ?;Blau syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most affected individuals have one parent with the condition.  In some cases, people with the characteristic features of Blau syndrome do not have a family history of the condition. Some researchers believe that these individuals have a non-inherited version of the disorder called early-onset sarcoidosis.;Blau syndrome is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the condition. However, in some cases, it can also be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning that both copies of the gene must be mutated for the condition to manifest. In either case, the inheritance pattern is characterized by a 50% chance of an affected parent passing the mutated gene to their offspring.;0.119;62.0;66.0;0.435;0.185;0.348;0.84;0.248;0.176;0.32
597;gemini-pro;treatment;What are the treatments for Gastritis ?;"Health care providers treat gastritis with medications to
                
- reduce the amount of acid in the stomach  - treat the underlying cause
                
Reduce the Amount of Acid in the Stomach
                
The stomach lining of a person with gastritis may have less protection from acidic digestive juice. Reducing acid can promote healing of the stomach lining. Medications that reduce acid include
                
- antacids, such as Alka-Seltzer, Maalox, Mylanta, Rolaids, and Riopan. Many brands use different combinations of three basic saltsmagnesium, aluminum, and calciumalong with hydroxide or bicarbonate ions to neutralize stomach acid. Antacids, however, can have side effects. Magnesium salt can lead to diarrhea, and aluminum salt can cause constipation. Magnesium and aluminum salts are often combined in a single product to balance these effects. Calcium carbonate antacids, such as Tums, Titralac, and Alka-2, can cause constipation.  - H2 blockers, such as cimetidine (Tagamet HB), famotidine (Pepcid AC), nizatidine (Axid AR), and ranitidine (Zantac 75). H2 blockers decrease acid production. They are available in both over-the-counter and prescription strengths.  - proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) include omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid), lansoprazole (Prevacid), dexlansoprazole (Dexilant), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (AcipHex), and esomeprazole (Nexium). PPIs decrease acid production more effectively than H2 blockers. All of these medications are available by prescription. Omeprazole and lansoprazole are also available in over-the-counter strength.
                
Treat the Underlying Cause
                
Depending on the cause of gastritis, a health care provider may recommend additional treatments.
                
- Treating H. pylori infection with antibiotics is important, even if a person does not have symptoms from the infection. Curing the infection often cures the gastritis and decreases the chance of developing complications, such as peptic ulcer disease, MALT lymphoma, and gastric cancer.  - Avoiding the cause of reactive gastritis can provide some people with a cure. For example, if prolonged NSAID use is the cause of the gastritis, a health care provider may advise the patient to stop taking the NSAIDs, reduce the dose, or change pain medications.  - Health care providers may prescribe medications to prevent or treat stress gastritis in a patient who is critically ill or injured. Medications to protect the stomach lining include sucralfate (Carafate), H2 blockers, and PPIs. Treating the underlying illness or injury most often cures stress gastritis.  - Health care providers may treat people with pernicious anemia due to autoimmune atrophic gastritis with vitamin B12 injections.";"Gastritis treatments vary depending on the underlying cause. Common treatments include:
* Antacids: These medications neutralize stomach acid and can provide relief from heartburn, indigestion, and pain.
* Histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs): These medications reduce stomach acid production.
* Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): These medications block stomach acid production and are more effective than H2RAs.
* Antibiotics: These medications are used to treat gastritis caused by bacterial infection, such as H. pylori.
* Prokinetics: These medications help to move food and fluids through the stomach and intestines more quickly.
* Lifestyle changes: Avoiding spicy, fatty, or acidic foods, quitting smoking, and reducing alcohol consumption can help to reduce symptoms of gastritis.";0.007;350.0;103.0;0.316;0.085;0.195;0.713;-0.129;-0.325;0.081

Symptoms of GSD 4 usually begin in infancy and typically include failure to thrive; enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly); and in many cases, progressive liver cirrhosis and liver failure. In rare cases individuals may have a form with non-progressive liver disease, or a severe neuromuscular form. GSD 4 is caused by mutations in the GBE1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment typically focuses on the specific symptoms that are present in each individual.";Glycogen storage disease type IV, also known as Andersen's disease, is a rare inherited disorder that affects the body's ability to store and use glycogen, a complex sugar that serves as an energy source for cells. In this condition, a deficiency or absence of the enzyme branching enzyme leads to the accumulation of abnormal glycogen in the liver, resulting in liver damage, growth retardation, hypoglycemia, and a distinctive facial appearance characterized by a chubby face, prominent eyes, and a broad nose.

The majority of individuals with TOS will improve with exercise and physical therapy. Vascular TOS, and true neurogenic TOS often require surgery to relieve pressure on the affected vessel or nerve.;The outlook for thoracic outlet syndrome varies depending on the severity of the condition and the type of treatment received. With conservative treatment, such as physical therapy and pain medication, most people with mild to moderate thoracic outlet syndrome can experience improvement in their symptoms. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to relieve the compression on the nerves and blood vessels. After surgery, most people experience significant improvement in their symptoms and are able to return to their normal activities. However, some people may experience persistent symptoms or develop complications, such as nerve damage or blood clots.

600;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Mitochondrial genetic disorders ?;"Mitochondrial genetic disorders refer to a group of conditions that affect the mitochondria (the structures in each cell of the body that are responsible for making energy). People with these conditions can present at any age with almost any affected body system; however, the brain, muscles, heart, liver, nerves, eyes, ears and kidneys are the organs and tissues most commonly affected. Symptom severity can also vary widely. Mitochondrial genetic disorders can be caused by changes (mutations) in either the mitochondrial DNA or nuclear DNA that lead to dysfunction of the mitochondria and inadequate production of energy. Those caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA are transmitted by maternal inheritance, while those caused by mutations in nuclear DNA may follow an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked pattern of inheritance. Treatment varies based on the specific type of condition and the signs and symptoms present in each person.";Mitochondrial genetic disorders are a group of conditions caused by mutations in the DNA of mitochondria, the energy-producing structures found in cells. These disorders can affect multiple organs and systems in the body, leading to a wide range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, fatigue, seizures, intellectual disability, vision and hearing problems, heart failure, and diabetes. Mitochondrial genetic disorders are typically inherited, either from both parents (autosomal recessive inheritance) or from the mother (mitochondrial inheritance). Treatment for these disorders is supportive and aims to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.

601;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to methemoglobinemia, beta-globin type ?;"Methemoglobinemia, beta-globin type is caused by mutations in the HBB gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called beta-globin. Beta-globin is one of four components (subunits) that make up hemoglobin. In adults, hemoglobin normally contains two subunits of beta-globin and two subunits of another protein called alpha-globin. Each of these protein subunits is bound to an iron-containing molecule called heme; each heme contains an iron molecule in its center that can bind to one oxygen molecule. For hemoglobin to bind to oxygen, the iron within the heme molecule needs to be in a form called ferrous iron (Fe2+). The iron within the heme can change to another form of iron called ferric iron (Fe3+), which cannot bind oxygen. Hemoglobin that contains ferric iron is known as methemoglobin.  HBB gene mutations that cause methemoglobinemia, beta-globin type change the structure of beta-globin and promote the heme iron to change from ferrous to ferric. The ferric iron cannot bind oxygen and causes cyanosis and the brown appearance of blood.";Methemoglobinemia, beta-globin type, is a rare inherited blood disorder characterized by the presence of an abnormal form of hemoglobin, known as hemoglobin M (HbM). This abnormal hemoglobin has a reduced ability to carry oxygen, leading to a lack of oxygen delivery to the body's tissues. The genetic changes associated with methemoglobinemia, beta-globin type, involve mutations in the HBB gene, which provides instructions for making the beta-globin protein, a component of hemoglobin. These mutations can result in the production of an unstable or dysfunctional beta-globin protein, leading to the formation of HbM and the development of methemoglobinemia.;0.055;155.0;82.0;0.429;0.102;0.302;0.781;0.192;0.065;0.323
602;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to ovarian cancer ?;"Cancers occur when a buildup of mutations in critical genesthose that control cell growth and division or repair damaged DNAallow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. Most cases of ovarian cancer are sporadic; in these cases the associated genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the ovary. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in the TP53 gene occur in almost half of all ovarian cancers. The protein produced from this gene is described as a tumor suppressor because it helps keep cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the p53 protein, which reduces or eliminates the protein's tumor suppressor function. Because the altered protein is less able to regulate cell growth and division, a cancerous tumor may develop. Somatic mutations in many other genes have also been found in ovarian cancer cells.  In hereditary ovarian cancer, the associated genetic changes are passed down within a family. These changes, classified as germline mutations, are present in all the body's cells. In people with germline mutations, other inherited and somatic gene changes, together with environmental and lifestyle factors, also influence whether a woman will develop ovarian cancer.  Germline mutations are involved in more than one-fifth of ovarian cancer cases. Between 65 and 85 percent of these mutations are in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. These gene mutations are described as ""high penetrance"" because they are associated with a high risk of developing ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and several other types of cancer in women. Compared to a 1.6 percent lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer for women in the total population, the lifetime risk in women with a BRCA1 gene mutation is 40 to 60 percent, and the lifetime risk in women with a BRCA2 gene mutation is 20 to 35 percent. Men with mutations in these genes also have an increased risk of developing several forms of cancer. The proteins produced from the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are tumor suppressors that are involved in fixing damaged DNA, which helps to maintain the stability of a cell's genetic information. Mutations in these genes impair DNA repair, allowing potentially damaging mutations to persist in DNA. As these defects accumulate, they can trigger cells to grow and divide without control or order to form a tumor.  A significantly increased risk of ovarian cancer is also a feature of certain rare genetic syndromes, including a disorder called Lynch syndrome. Lynch syndrome is most often associated with mutations in the MLH1 or MSH2 gene and accounts for between 10 and 15 percent of hereditary ovarian cancers. Other rare genetic syndromes may also be associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. The proteins produced from the genes associated with these syndromes act as tumor suppressors. Mutations in any of these genes can allow cells to grow and divide unchecked, leading to the development of a cancerous tumor. Like BRCA1 and BRCA2, these genes are considered ""high penetrance"" because mutations greatly increase a person's chance of developing cancer. In addition to ovarian cancer, mutations in these genes increase the risk of several other types of cancer in both men and women.  Germline mutations in dozens of other genes have been studied as possible risk factors for ovarian cancer. These genes are described as ""low penetrance"" or ""moderate penetrance"" because changes in each of these genes appear to make only a small or moderate contribution to overall ovarian cancer risk. Some of these genes provide instructions for making proteins that interact with the proteins produced from the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. Others act through different pathways. Researchers suspect that the combined influence of variations in these genes may significantly impact a person's risk of developing ovarian cancer.  In many families, the genetic changes associated with hereditary ovarian cancer are unknown. Identifying additional genetic risk factors for ovarian cancer is an active area of medical research.  In addition to genetic changes, researchers have identified many personal and environmental factors that contribute to a woman's risk of developing ovarian cancer. These factors include age, ethnic background, and hormonal and reproductive factors. A history of ovarian cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor, particularly if the cancer occurred in early adulthood.";"Ovarian cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease with various genetic alterations contributing to its development and progression. Some key genetic changes associated with ovarian cancer include:

1. **BRCA1 and BRCA2 Mutations:** Inherited mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are the most well-known genetic risk factors for ovarian cancer. These genes play a vital role in DNA repair, and mutations in these genes impair the ability of cells to repair DNA damage, leading to genomic instability and increased susceptibility to cancer.

2. **TP53 Mutations:** TP53 is a tumor suppressor gene responsible for regulating cell growth and preventing uncontrolled cell division. Mutations in TP53 are commonly found in ovarian cancer, leading to loss of its tumor-suppressing function and promoting cancer cell growth and survival.

3. **Copy Number Alterations:** Changes in the number of copies of specific genes or chromosomal regions are common in ovarian cancer. These alterations can result in the amplification of oncogenes, driving excessive cell growth and proliferation, or the deletion of tumor suppressor genes, compromising their ability to control cell growth and prevent tumor formation.

4. **Microsatellite Instability:** Microsatellite instability (MSI) refers to alterations in the length of repetitive DNA sequences called microsatellites. MSI is observed in a subset of ovarian cancers and is associated with defective DNA mismatch repair mechanisms. MSI can lead to mutations in various genes, contributing to cancer development and progression.

5. **Epigenetic Alterations:** Epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, can also play a role in ovarian cancer. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns can lead to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes, while abnormal histone modifications can alter gene expression and promote cancer cell growth and survival.

6. **Other Genetic Alterations:** Numerous other genetic changes have been identified in ovarian cancer, including mutations in genes involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA damage response, angiogenesis, and metastasis. These alterations contribute to the complex molecular landscape of ovarian cancer and provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention.";0.041;678.0;309.0;0.287;0.098;0.164;0.747;0.024;-0.016;0.062
603;gemini-pro;exams and tests;How to diagnose Angina ?;"The most important issues to address when you go to the doctor with chest pain are:
                
What's causing the chest pain
                
Whether you're having or are about to have a heart attack
                
Angina is a symptom of an underlying heart problem, usually coronary heart disease (CHD). The type of angina pain you have can be a sign of how severe the CHD is and whether it's likely to cause a heart attack.
                
If you have chest pain, your doctor will want to find out whether it's angina. He or she also will want to know whether the angina is stable or unstable. If it's unstable, you may need emergency medical treatment to try to prevent a heart attack.
                
To diagnose chest pain as stable or unstable angina, your doctor will do a physical exam, ask about your symptoms, and ask about your risk factors for and your family history of CHD or other heart diseases.
                
Your doctor also may ask questions about your symptoms, such as:
                
What brings on the pain or discomfort and what relieves it?
                
What does the pain or discomfort feel like (for example, heaviness or tightness)?
                
How often does the pain occur?
                
Where do you feel the pain or discomfort?
                
How severe is the pain or discomfort?
                
How long does the pain or discomfort last?
                
Diagnostic Tests and Procedures
                
If your doctor thinks that you have unstable angina or that your angina is related to a serious heart condition, he or she may recommend one or more tests.
                
EKG (Electrocardiogram)
                
An EKG is a simple, painless test that detects and records the hearts electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through the heart.
                
An EKG can show signs of heart damage due to CHD and signs of a previous or current heart attack. However, some people who have angina have normal EKGs.
                
Stress Testing
                
During stress testing, you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done. If you cant exercise, you may be given medicine to make your heart work hard and beat fast.
                
When your heart is working hard and beating fast, it needs more blood and oxygen. Plaque-narrowed arteries can't supply enough oxygen-rich blood to meet your heart's needs.
                
A stress test can show possible signs and symptoms of CHD, such as:
                
Abnormal changes in your heart rate or blood pressure
                
Shortness of breath or chest pain
                
Abnormal changes in your heart rhythm or your heart's electrical activity
                
As part of some stress tests, pictures are taken of your heart while you exercise and while you rest. These imaging stress tests can show how well blood is flowing in various parts of your heart. They also can show how well your heart pumps blood when it beats.
                
Chest X Ray
                
A chest x ray takes pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels.
                
A chest x ray can reveal signs of heart failure. It also can show signs of lung disorders and other causes of symptoms not related to CHD. However, a chest x ray alone is not enough to diagnose angina or CHD.
                
Coronary Angiography and Cardiac Catheterization
                
Your doctor may recommend coronary angiography (an-jee-OG-ra-fee) if he or she suspects you have CHD. This test uses dye and special x rays to show the inside of your coronary arteries.
                
To get the dye into your coronary arteries, your doctor will use a procedure called cardiac catheterization (KATH-e-ter-ih-ZA-shun).
                
A thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. The tube is threaded into your coronary arteries, and the dye is released into your bloodstream.
                
Special x rays are taken while the dye is flowing through your coronary arteries. The dye lets your doctor study the flow of blood through your heart and blood vessels.
                
Cardiac catheterization usually is done in a hospital. You're awake during the procedure. It usually causes little or no pain, although you may feel some soreness in the blood vessel where your doctor inserts the catheter.
                
Computed Tomography Angiography
                
Computed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee) angiography (CTA) uses dye and special x rays to show blood flow through the coronary arteries. This test is less invasive than coronary angiography with cardiac catheterization.
                
For CTA, a needle connected to an intravenous (IV) line is put into a vein in your hand or arm. Dye is injected through the IV line during the scan. You may have a warm feeling when this happens. The dye highlights your blood vessels on the CT scan pictures.
                
Sticky patches called electrodes are put on your chest. The patches are attached to an EKG machine to record your heart's electrical activity during the scan.
                
The CT scanner is a large machine that has a hollow, circular tube in the middle. You lie on your back on a sliding table. The table slowly slides into the opening of the machine.
                
Inside the scanner, an x-ray tube moves around your body to take pictures of different parts of your heart. A computer puts the pictures together to make a three-dimensional (3D) picture of the whole heart.
                
Blood Tests
                
Blood tests check the levels of certain fats, cholesterol, sugar, and proteins in your blood. Abnormal levels may show that you have risk factors for CHD.
                
Your doctor may recommend a blood test to check the level of a protein called C-reactive protein (CRP) in your blood. Some studies suggest that high levels of CRP in the blood may increase the risk for CHD and heart attack.
                
Your doctor also may recommend a blood test to check for low levels of hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin) in your blood. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells. It helps the blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to all parts of your body. If your hemoglobin level is low, you may have a condition called anemia (uh-NEE-me-uh).";Diagnosing angina typically involves a comprehensive evaluation that includes a detailed medical history, physical examination, and various diagnostic tests. The healthcare provider will inquire about the patient's symptoms, such as chest pain or discomfort, its characteristics, frequency, and duration. They will also assess the patient's risk factors for coronary artery disease, including age, gender, family history, smoking, hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, and obesity. Physical examination may involve listening to the heart and lungs for abnormal sounds and checking blood pressure. Diagnostic tests may include an electrocardiogram (ECG) to detect abnormal heart rhythms or signs of ischemia, a stress test to evaluate the heart's response to physical exertion, an echocardiogram to assess the heart's structure and function, and coronary angiography to visualize the coronary arteries and identify any blockages or narrowing.;0.0;926.0;118.0;0.217;0.04;0.123;0.688;-0.082;-0.195;0.033

610;gemini-pro;treatment;What are the treatments for Hemangioendothelioma ?;"How might hemangioendothelioma be treated? Treatment for hemangioendothelioma may depend on the type of hemangioendothelioma present in the affected individual and the risk of recurrence or metastases. In most reported cases, surgical excision (removal) of the mass has been the only treatment. For spindle cell hemangioma, simple excision is reportedly curative; however, new growths develop in adjacent skin and soft tissues in 60% of affected individuals. For individuals with papillary intralymphatic angioendothelioma (PILA), excision of the involved lymph nodes, as well as the mass, has been recommended. Surgical excision is reportedly also the usual treatment for individuals with retiform hemangioendothelioma (although local recurrence with this type is common), epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, and composite hemangioendothelioma (with the exception of 1 case treated with interferon). Most individuals with pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma have been treated with simple excision, but a few individuals have also received post-surgical radiotherapy (RT). With regard to kaposiform hemangioendothelioma, some large lesions cannot be completely removed and may cause fatal complications due to the associated KasabachMerritt syndrome. In these cases, several medical therapies have been used, including systemic corticosteroids; alfa interferon; RT; embolization; and several other therapies, both alone and in various combinations. A study by Scott et al published in 2012 in the American Journal of Clinical Oncology evaluated the effectiveness of RT as either an alternative or adjunct to surgery. The authors stated that the effectiveness of definitive RT in the treatment of hemangioendothelioma in their study implies that radiation may be an acceptable alternative when surgical resection will compromise function or cosmetic result. They concluded that with no local recurrences and minimal risk of toxicity, their long-term data suggest that RT offers a highly effective management option for this disease.";Hemangioendothelioma treatments vary depending on the size, location, and severity of the tumor. Treatment options may include surgery to remove the tumor, radiation therapy to shrink the tumor or prevent its growth, chemotherapy to kill cancer cells, targeted therapy to block the growth of cancer cells, embolization to block the blood supply to the tumor, or a combination of these treatments. In some cases, observation without immediate treatment may be recommended.;0.001;262.0;63.0;0.168;0.007;0.099;0.679;-0.126;-0.269;0.021

In people with this condition, the heart (cardiac) muscle takes less time than usual to recharge between beats. The term ""short QT"" refers to a specific pattern of heart activity that is detected with an electrocardiogram (EKG), which is a test used to measure the electrical activity of the heart. In people with this condition, the part of the heartbeat known as the QT interval is abnormally short.  If untreated, the arrhythmia associated with short QT syndrome can lead to a variety of signs and symptoms, from dizziness and fainting (syncope) to cardiac arrest and sudden death. These signs and symptoms can occur any time from early infancy to old age. This condition may explain some cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), which is a major cause of unexplained death in babies younger than 1 year. However, some people with short QT syndrome never experience any health problems associated with the condition.";Short QT syndrome is a rare heart condition characterized by an unusually short QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG). This interval represents the time it takes for the heart to contract and then relax, and a shorter interval means that the heart rate is faster. Short QT syndrome can be caused by genetic mutations or certain medications, and it can increase the risk of sudden cardiac arrest, a potentially fatal heart rhythm disturbance. Symptoms may include palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, and fainting.

613;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to frontonasal dysplasia ?;Mutations in the ALX3 gene cause frontonasal dysplasia type 1, ALX4 gene mutations cause type 2, and ALX1 gene mutations cause type 3. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are necessary for normal development, particularly of the head and face, before birth. The proteins produced from the ALX3, ALX4, and ALX1 genes are transcription factors, which means they attach (bind) to DNA and control the activity of certain genes. Specifically, the proteins control the activity of genes that regulate cell growth and division (proliferation) and movement (migration), ensuring that cells grow and stop growing at specific times and that they are positioned correctly during development. The ALX3 and ALX4 proteins are primarily involved in the development of the nose and surrounding tissues, while the ALX1 protein is involved in development of the eyes, nose, and mouth.  ALX3, ALX4, or ALX1 gene mutations reduce or eliminate function of the respective protein. As a result, the regulation of cell organization during development of the head and face is disrupted, particularly affecting the middle of the face. Abnormal development of the nose, philtrum, and upper lip leads to the facial clefts that characterize this disorder. This abnormal development also interferes with the proper formation of the skull and other facial structures, leading to anterior cranium bifidum occultum, hypertelorism, and other features of frontonasal dysplasia.;"The following changes related to frontal dysplasia are common:

617;gemini-pro;treatment;What are the treatments for Polycythemia Vera ?;"Polycythemia vera (PV) doesn't have a cure. However, treatments can help control the disease and its complications. PV is treated with procedures, medicines, and other methods. You may need one or more treatments to manage the disease.
                
Goals of Treatment
                
The goals of treating PV are to control symptoms and reduce the risk of complications, especially heart attack and stroke. To do this, PV treatments reduce the number of red blood cells and the level of hemoglobin (an iron-rich protein) in the blood. This brings the thickness of your blood closer to normal.
                
Blood with normal thickness flows better through the blood vessels. This reduces the chance that blood clots will form and cause a heart attack or stroke.
                
Blood with normal thickness also ensures that your body gets enough oxygen. This can help reduce some of the signs and symptoms of PV, such as headaches, vision problems, and itching.
                
Studies show that treating PV greatly improves your chances of living longer.
                
The goal of treating secondary polycythemia is to control its underlying cause, if possible. For example, if the cause is carbon monoxide exposure, the goal is to find the source of the carbon monoxide and fix or remove it.
                
Treatments To Lower Red Blood Cell Levels
                
Phlebotomy
                
Phlebotomy (fle-BOT-o-me) is a procedure that removes some blood from your body. For this procedure, a needle is inserted into one of your veins. Blood from the vein flows through an airtight tube into a sterile container or bag. The process is similar to the process of donating blood.
                
Phlebotomy reduces your red blood cell count and starts to bring your blood thickness closer to normal.
                
Typically, a pint (1 unit) of blood is removed each week until your hematocrit level approaches normal. (Hematocrit is the measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood.)
                
You may need to have phlebotomy done every few months.
                
Medicines
                
Your doctor may prescribe medicines to keep your bone marrow from making too many red blood cells. Examples of these medicines include hydroxyurea and interferon-alpha.
                
Hydroxyurea is a medicine generally used to treat cancer. This medicine can reduce the number of red blood cells and platelets in your blood. As a result, this medicine helps improve your blood flow and bring the thickness of your blood closer to normal.
                
Interferon-alpha is a substance that your body normally makes. It also can be used to treat PV. Interferon-alpha can prompt your immune system to fight overactive bone marrow cells. This helps lower your red blood cell count and keep your blood flow and blood thickness closer to normal.
                
Radiation Treatment
                
Radiation treatment can help suppress overactive bone marrow cells. This helps lower your red blood cell count and keep your blood flow and blood thickness closer to normal.
                
However, radiation treatment can raise your risk of leukemia (blood cancer) and other blood diseases.
                
Treatments for Symptoms
                
Aspirin can relieve bone pain and burning feelings in your hands or feet that you may have as a result of PV. Aspirin also thins your blood, so it reduces the risk of blood clots.
                
Aspirin can have side effects, including bleeding in the stomach and intestines. For this reason, take aspirin only as your doctor recommends.
                
If your PV causes itching, your doctor may prescribe medicines to ease the discomfort. Your doctor also may prescribe ultraviolet light treatment to help relieve your itching.
                
Other ways to reduce itching include:
                
Avoiding hot baths. Cooler water can limit irritation to your skin.
                
Gently patting yourself dry after bathing. Vigorous rubbing with a towel can irritate your skin.
                
Taking starch baths. Add half a box of starch to a tub of lukewarm water. This can help soothe your skin.
                
Experimental Treatments
                
Researchers are studying other treatments for PV. An experimental treatment for itching involves taking low doses of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). This type of medicine is used to treat depression. In clinical trials, SSRIs reduced itching in people who had PV.
                
Imatinib mesylate is a medicine that's approved for treating leukemia. In clinical trials, this medicine helped reduce the need for phlebotomy in people who had PV. This medicine also helped reduce the size of enlarged spleens.
                
Researchers also are trying to find a treatment that can block or limit the effects of an abnormal JAK2 gene. (A mutation, or change, in the JAK2 gene is the major cause of PV.)";Polycythemia Vera (PV) is a blood cancer characterized by an excess of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in the blood. The primary treatment for PV aims to reduce the number of blood cells and prevent complications such as blood clots, heart attacks, and strokes. The most common treatment option is phlebotomy, a procedure where blood is periodically drawn from the patient's body to lower the red blood cell count. Additionally, medications like hydroxyurea or interferon may be prescribed to suppress the bone marrow's production of blood cells. In some cases, low-dose aspirin may also be recommended to prevent blood clots. In severe cases, stem cell transplantation may be considered as a curative option.;0.001;685.0;105.0;0.224;0.074;0.141;0.777;0.015;-0.142;0.178

619;gemini-pro;prevention;How to prevent Parasites - Leishmaniasis ?;"No vaccines or drugs to prevent infection are available. The best way for travelers to prevent infection is to protect themselves from sand fly bites. To decrease the risk of being bitten, follow these preventive measures:
    
Avoid outdoor activities, especially from dusk to dawn, when sand flies generally are the most active.
    
When outdoors (or in unprotected quarters):
    
     - Minimize the amount of exposed (uncovered) skin. To the extent that is tolerable in the climate, wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and socks; and tuck your shirt into your pants. (See below about wearing insecticide-treated clothing.)
     - Apply insect repellent to exposed skin and under the ends of sleeves and pant legs. Follow the instructions on the label of the repellent. The most effective repellents generally are those that contain the chemical DEET (N,N-diethylmetatoluamide).
    
    
     
       
       
        
         
          
         
        
        
        
      
     
    
    
When indoors:
    
     - Stay in well-screened or air-conditioned areas.
     - Keep in mind that sand flies are much smaller than mosquitoes and therefore can get through smaller holes.
     - Spray living/sleeping areas with an insecticide to kill insects.
     - If you are not sleeping in a well-screened or air-conditioned area, use a bed net and tuck it under your mattress. If possible, use a bed net that has been soaked in or sprayed with a pyrethroid-containing insecticide. The same treatment can be applied to screens, curtains, sheets, and clothing (clothing should be retreated after five washings).

If the blood is more acidic than it should be and the urine less acidic than it should be, RTA may be the reason, but additional information is needed to rule out other causes. If RTA is the reason, additional information about the sodium, potassium, and chloride levels in the urine and the potassium level in the blood will help identify which type of RTA a person has. In all cases, the first goal of therapy is to neutralize acid in the blood, but different treatments may be needed to address the different underlying causes of acidosis.;"Renal Tubular Acidosis (RTA) is a group of disorders characterized by the inability of the kidneys to properly reabsorb bicarbonate and secrete hydrogen ions, leading to an imbalance in the body's acid-base balance. To diagnose RTA, a comprehensive evaluation is typically conducted, including:

- **Medical History:** A detailed medical history is taken to gather information about symptoms, current medications, and any previous kidney problems.

- **Physical Examination:** A physical exam is performed to assess signs of dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and any abnormalities in the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems.

- **Laboratory Tests:** Blood tests are done to measure serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate), blood pH, and blood gases. Urine tests are also performed to assess urine pH, electrolytes, and the presence of glucose and protein.

- **Imaging Studies:** Imaging tests like ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scans may be used to evaluate the kidneys' structure and rule out any underlying anatomical abnormalities or obstructive conditions.

- **Provocative Tests:** In some cases, provocative tests may be conducted to assess the kidney's ability to respond to an acid load. This can involve administering an oral acid load (e.g., ammonium chloride) and monitoring the subsequent changes in urine and blood pH and electrolytes.";0.026;97.0;181.0;0.279;0.079;0.14;0.806;-0.025;0.067;-0.117

628;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Sarcoidosis ?;"Espaol
                
Sarcoidosis (sar-koy-DO-sis) is a disease of unknown cause that leads to inflammation. This disease affects your bodys organs.
                
Normally, your immune system defends your body against foreign or harmful substances. For example, it sends special cells to protect organs that are in danger.
                
These cells release chemicals that recruit other cells to isolate and destroy the harmful substance. Inflammation occurs during this process. Once the harmful substance is gone, the cells and the inflammation go away.
                
In people who have sarcoidosis, the inflammation doesn't go away. Instead, some of the immune system cells cluster to form lumps called granulomas (gran-yu-LO-mas) in various organs in your body.
                
Overview
                
Sarcoidosis can affect any organ in your body. However, it's more likely to affect some organs than others. The disease usually starts in the lungs, skin, and/or lymph nodes (especially the lymph nodes in your chest).
                
Also, the disease often affects the eyes and liver. Although less common, sarcoidosis can affect the heart and brain, leading to serious complications.
                
If many granulomas form in an organ, they can affect how the organ works. This can cause signs and symptoms. Signs and symptoms vary depending on which organs are affected. Many people who have sarcoidosis have no signs or symptoms or mild ones.
                
Lofgren's syndrome is a classic set of signs and symptoms that is typical in some people who have sarcoidosis. Lofgren's syndrome may cause fever, enlarged lymph nodes, arthritis (usually in the ankles), and/or erythema nodosum (er-ih-THE-ma no-DO-sum).
                
Erythema nodosum is a rash of red or reddish-purple bumps on your ankles and shins. The rash may be warm and tender to the touch.
                
Treatment for sarcoidosis varies depending on which organs are affected. Your doctor may prescribe topical treatments and/or medicines to treat the disease. Not everyone who has sarcoidosis needs treatment.
                
Outlook
                
The outlook for sarcoidosis varies. Many people recover from the disease with few or no long-term problems.
                
More than half of the people who have sarcoidosis have remission within 3 years of diagnosis. Remission means the disease isn't active, but it can return.
                
Two-thirds of people who have the disease have remission within 10 years of diagnosis. People who have Lofgren's syndrome usually have remission. Relapse (return of the disease) 1 or more years after remission occurs in less than 5 percent of patients.
                
Sarcoidosis leads to organ damage in about one-third of the people diagnosed with the disease. Damage may occur over many years and involve more than one organ. Rarely, sarcoidosis can be fatal. Death usually is the result of problems with the lungs, heart, or brain.
                
Poor outcomes are more likely in people who have advanced disease and show little improvement from treatment.
                
Certain people are at higher risk for poor outcomes from chronic (long-term) sarcoidosis. This includes people who have lung scarring, heart or brain complications, or lupus pernio (LU-pus PUR-ne-o). Lupus pernio is a serious skin condition that sarcoidosis may cause.
                
Research is ongoing for new and better treatments for sarcoidosis.";Sarcoidosis is a multi-system inflammatory disorder characterized by the presence of non-caseating granulomas, which are small collections of inflammatory cells, in various organs and tissues of the body. It commonly affects the lungs, but can also involve the skin, lymph nodes, liver, spleen, eyes, and heart. The cause of sarcoidosis is unknown, but it is thought to be related to an overactive immune response to an unknown trigger, possibly an infection or environmental factor. Symptoms of sarcoidosis vary depending on the organs affected, but may include fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, skin rashes, joint pain, and swollen lymph nodes. Treatment for sarcoidosis is typically aimed at reducing inflammation and suppressing the overactive immune response, and may involve corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, or other medications.;0.002;466.0;112.0;0.293;0.036;0.181;0.792;-0.102;-0.217;0.014

Deposits of light chains can also occur in the liver, heart, small intestine, spleen, skin, nervous system and bone marrow. Additionally, about 50-60% of patients with LCDD have multiple myeloma and 17% have a disease called monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS). Early signs and symptoms of light chain deposition disease may include protein in the urine, high blood pressure, decreased kidney function, and nephrotic syndrome. The goal of treatment in patients with LCDD is to stop/decrease the production of light chains and damage to organs. Treatment options can include: autologous stem cell transplantation; a drug called Bortezomib; a class of drugs called immunomodulatory drugs; and kidney transplant.";Light chain disease is a rare plasma cell proliferative disorder in which the abnormal plasma cells produce immunoglobulin fragments, predominantly immunoglobulin light chains. It is a rare type of lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by the overproduction of immunoglobulin light chains, specifically kappa or lambda light chains, by monoclonal plasma cells.

Additionally, supportive therapies such as pain relievers and anti-inflammatory medications may be used to manage symptoms like joint pain and inflammation. Regular monitoring of uric acid levels and kidney function is also essential to assess the effectiveness of treatment and to prevent potential complications.;0.015;52.0;92.0;0.176;0.03;0.137;0.718;-0.06;-0.035;-0.088
633;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) inclusion body myopathy with early-onset Paget disease and frontotemporal dementia ?;Inclusion body myopathy with early-onset Paget disease and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) is a condition that can affect the muscles, bones, and brain.  The first symptom of IBMPFD is often muscle weakness (myopathy), which typically appears in mid-adulthood. Weakness first occurs in muscles of the hips and shoulders, making it difficult to climb stairs and raise the arms above the shoulders. As the disorder progresses, weakness develops in other muscles in the arms and legs. Muscle weakness can also affect respiratory and heart (cardiac) muscles, leading to life-threatening breathing difficulties and heart failure.  About half of all adults with IBMPFD develop a disorder called Paget disease of bone. This disorder most often affects bones of the hips, spine, and skull, and the long bones of the arms and legs. Bone pain, particularly in the hips and spine, is usually the major symptom of Paget disease. Rarely, this condition can weaken bones so much that they break (fracture).  In about one-third of people with IBMPFD, the disorder also affects the brain. IBMPFD is associated with a brain condition called frontotemporal dementia, which becomes noticeable in a person's forties or fifties. Frontotemporal dementia progressively damages parts of the brain that control reasoning, personality, social skills, speech, and language. People with this condition initially may have trouble speaking, remembering words and names (dysnomia), and using numbers (dyscalculia). Personality changes, a loss of judgment, and inappropriate social behavior are also hallmarks of the disease. As the dementia worsens, affected people ultimately become unable to speak, read, or care for themselves.  People with IBMPFD usually live into their fifties or sixties.;Inclusion body myopathy with early-onset Paget disease and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a combination of muscle weakness, bone disease, and dementia. The muscle weakness typically begins in adulthood and affects the muscles of the limbs, trunk, and face. The bone disease, known as Paget disease, leads to abnormal bone growth and can cause pain and deformities. The dementia, which is a type of frontotemporal dementia, affects the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain and can cause changes in personality, behavior, and language. IBMPFD is caused by mutations in the VCP gene, which encodes a protein involved in cellular processes such as protein degradation and DNA repair. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that only one copy of the mutated gene is needed to cause the condition.;0.058;243.0;121.0;0.316;0.096;0.22;0.834;0.07;-0.011;0.15
634;gemini-pro;information;Do you have information about Angioplasty;Summary : If you have coronary artery disease, the arteries in your heart are narrowed or blocked by a sticky material called plaque. Angioplasty is a procedure to restore blood flow through the artery.    You have angioplasty in a hospital. The doctor threads a thin tube through a blood vessel in the arm or groin up to the involved site in the artery. The tube has a tiny balloon on the end. When the tube is in place, the doctor inflates the balloon to push the plaque outward against the wall of the artery. This widens the artery and restores blood flow.    Doctors may use angioplasty to       - Reduce chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart    - Minimize damage to heart muscle from a heart attack       Many people go home the day after angioplasty, and are able to return to work within a week of coming home.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute;Angioplasty is a minimally invasive procedure used to widen narrowed or blocked blood vessels. It involves inserting a thin, flexible tube (catheter) with a tiny balloon at its tip into the narrowed artery. The balloon is then inflated, compressing the plaque against the artery walls and increasing blood flow. Angioplasty is often performed in conjunction with stenting, where a small mesh tube (stent) is inserted to keep the artery open. It is commonly used to treat coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, and renal artery stenosis. Angioplasty can improve blood flow, relieve symptoms such as chest pain and shortness of breath, and reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke. However, it is essential to note that angioplasty is not a cure for the underlying condition causing the narrowing, and lifestyle changes and medications may be necessary to manage the condition long-term.;0.037;129.0;128.0;0.307;0.073;0.182;0.787;0.173;0.169;0.174

637;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Factor V Leiden thrombophilia ?;Factor V Leiden thrombophilia is an inherited disorder that results in an increased risk of developing abnormal blood clots. Factor V Leiden is the name of a specific gene mutation in the F5 gene. This gene plays a critical role in the normal formation of blood clots in response to an injury. People can inherit one or two copies of the factor V Leiden gene mutation. Those who inherit one copy are called heterozygotes. People who inherit two copies of the mutation, one from each parent, are called homozygotes. Having the factor V Leiden mutation increases your risk for developing a clot in your legs called a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). It also increases your risk of developing a clot that travels through the bloodstream and lodges in the lungs, called a pulmonary embolism (PE).;Factor V Leiden thrombophilia is a genetic disorder that increases the risk of developing blood clots. It is caused by a mutation in the factor V gene, which leads to the production of an abnormal form of factor V protein. Factor V is a protein that plays a role in the blood clotting process. The abnormal form of factor V protein is more resistant to being broken down, which can lead to the formation of blood clots. People with Factor V Leiden thrombophilia have an increased risk of developing blood clots in the veins, especially in the legs and lungs. They also have an increased risk of developing blood clots during pregnancy, after surgery, or while taking certain medications.;0.128;118.0;104.0;0.469;0.167;0.297;0.899;0.275;0.192;0.358

People with early dry AMD have either several small drusen or a few medium-sized drusen. Drusen are yellow deposits under the retina which often are found in people over age 50. People with early AMD have no symptoms and no vision loss. People with intermediate dry AMD have either many medium-sized drusen or one or more large drusen. Some people see a blurred spot in the center of their vision. More light may be needed for reading and other tasks. In addition to drusen, people with advanced dry AMD have a breakdown of light-sensitive cells and supporting tissue in the macula. This breakdown can cause a blurred spot in the center of your vision. Over time, the blurred spot may get bigger and darker, taking more of your central vision. You may have difficulty reading or recognizing faces until they are very close to you.;Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common eye condition that affects the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp central vision. AMD is the leading cause of vision loss in people over 50 and is characterized by the deterioration of the macula, leading to blurred vision, difficulty reading, and central vision loss. It is caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, including aging, smoking, obesity, and high blood pressure. There are two main types of AMD: dry AMD, which is a slow, gradual loss of vision, and wet AMD, which is a more severe form characterized by abnormal blood vessel growth in the macula, leading to rapid vision loss and distortion. Treatment options for AMD vary depending on the type and severity of the condition and may include lifestyle changes, medications, injections, and laser therapy.;0.022;159.0;128.0;0.279;0.063;0.158;0.694;0.026;-0.021;0.072
639;gemini-pro;treatment;What are the treatments for Chronic fatigue syndrome ?;How might chronic fatigue syndrome be treated? Treatment options for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are limited.[9440] Treatment is largely supportive and is focused on the specific symptoms present in each individual. In most cases, symptoms of CFS lessen over time. Many therapies have been tried, but only cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and graded exercise therapy reportedly appear to produce meaningful benefit. CBT typically involves a series of one-hour sessions designed to alter beliefs and behaviors that might delay recovery. Graded exercise therapy can be beneficial because prolonged lack of exercise may worsen the symptoms of the condition and should be discouraged.[9440] Gradual introduction of regular aerobic exercise, such as walking, swimming, cycling, or jogging, under close medical supervision may reduce fatigue and improve physical function. The goal is to have 30 minutes of light exercise five times a week. To avoid overexertion it is recommended to set a target heart rate range, generally <100 beats per minute. Graded exercise should be always supervised by a physical therapist or exercise therapist. In some studies, women with this condition were found to have low normal fitness on treadmill testing with no indication of heart or lung problems. Maximal testing did not result in worse fatigue or other symptoms. Because many people who have CFS are also depressed, treating the depression can make it easier to cope with the problems associated with CFS. Low doses of some antidepressants may help improve sleep and relieve pain.[6269] A number of medications, special diets and vitamin supplements have been evaluated in individuals with CFS, but none have been proven effective. Although there have been a number of viruses that were initially reported to cause CFS, additional studies have not proven this.[9440] Trials of antiviral agents have been ineffective in relieving the symptoms of CFS. Several clinical trials aiming to find effective treatment are currently ongoing.;"Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) treatments aim to alleviate symptoms and improve overall well-being. Common approaches include:

- Lifestyle changes: Pacing techniques to manage activities, sleep hygiene, stress reduction, and a balanced diet can positively impact energy levels and reduce symptom severity.

- Medications: Doctors may prescribe medications to address specific symptoms, such as pain relievers, antidepressants, or stimulants, but there is no cure for CFS.

- Physical therapy: Supervised exercise programs can help individuals gradually increase activity levels and reduce fatigue.

- Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT): This therapy helps patients develop coping mechanisms, manage stress, and modify negative thoughts that exacerbate fatigue.

- Graded exercise therapy (GET): A specialized physical therapy program that gradually increases exercise intensity to improve stamina and reduce fatigue.";0.012;296.0;115.0;0.245;0.052;0.126;0.877;0.03;-0.09;0.154

It does, however, predispose patients to serious complications such as pneumonia secondary to difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia). The most common complications are choking and pneumonia, head injury, and fractures caused by falls. The most common cause of death is pneumonia. With good attention to medical and nutritional needs, however, most PSP patients live well into their 70s and beyond.;Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare and debilitating neurodegenerative disorder with no cure. The outlook for someone with PSP varies greatly, with the average life expectancy after diagnosis being six to 10 years. The disease typically progresses slowly over time, with symptoms gradually worsening. Early symptoms may include difficulty with balance, speech, and swallowing. As the disease progresses, individuals may experience problems with cognition, vision, and movement. Currently, there is no known way to stop or reverse the progression of PSP, and treatment focuses on managing symptoms and improving quality of life.

It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause this condition. In most cases, an affected individual inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the condition in their family. Most affected individuals (96%) that have inherited a gene mutation from their parent show signs and symptoms of this condition. However, the family history may appear negative because of the failure to recognize the disorder in family members and/or reduced penetrance. Reports have suggested that some females may not show clinical features of HMO but still have the gene mutation that causes this condition.;Hereditary multiple osteochondromas (HMO), also known as multiple hereditary exostoses, is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by the growth of multiple benign bone tumors called osteochondromas. These tumors typically develop around the growth plates of long bones, such as the femur, tibia, and humerus. HMO is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that only one copy of the mutated gene is needed to cause the disorder. In most cases, the mutated gene is inherited from a parent who has HMO, but in some cases, the mutation can occur spontaneously.;0.061;130.0;81.0;0.391;0.141;0.348;0.85;0.147;0.128;0.164

                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.

				                    Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of anal cancer.
				                    In the United States, the most common type of anal cancer is squamous cell carcinoma. Studies show that human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the main cause of this type of anal cancer.   Another type of anal cancer, called anal adenocarcinoma, is very rare and is not discussed in this summary.
				                
				                
				                    In the United States, the number of new cases of anal cancer has increased in recent years.
				                    From 2004 to 2013, new cases of anal cancer and deaths from anal cancer increased each year. The increase in new cases was slightly higher in women and the increase in deaths from anal cancer was slightly higher in men.";Anal cancer is a type of cancer that occurs in the anal canal, the short passageway that connects the rectum to the outside of the body. It is a relatively rare cancer, with an estimated 2,200 new cases diagnosed each year in the United States. Anal cancer is more common in men than in women, and the risk of developing the disease increases with age. The primary cause of anal cancer is infection with the human papillomavirus ( sexePV), a common virus that can also cause genital and throat cancers. Other risk factors for anal cancer include multiple sexual partners, a history of sexually transmitted infections, and being immunosuppressed (having a weakened immune system). The symptoms of anal cancer can include bleeding, pain, and difficulty with bowel movements. Treatment for anal cancer typically involves surgery to remove the tumor, followed by chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. The prognosis for anal cancer depends on the stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis, with early-stage cancers having a better prognosis than advanced-stage cancers.;0.033;259.0;148.0;0.304;0.102;0.137;0.827;-0.006;-0.02;0.004

Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for pituitary tumors include having the following hereditary diseases:         -  Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome.    -  Carney complex.    - Isolated familial acromegaly.";Pituitary tumors are usually noncancerous (benign) growths that develop in the pituitary gland, a small gland located at the base of the brain. The risk of developing a pituitary tumor increases with age, with most cases occurring in adults between 30 and 60 years old. People with a family history of pituitary tumors or certain genetic conditions, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) or Carney complex, are also at an increased risk. Additionally, certain medical conditions, such as Cushing's disease or acromegaly, can lead to the development of pituitary tumors.;0.117;78.0;83.0;0.389;0.164;0.283;0.586;0.121;0.099;0.141
649;gemini-pro;causes;What causes Autoimmune atrophic gastritis ?;What causes autoimmune atrophic gastritis? Autoimmune atrophic gastritis is considered an autoimmune disorder. In people who are affected by this condition, the immune system mistakenly attacks the healthy cells of the stomach lining. Overtime, this can wear away the stomach's protective barrier and interfere with the absorption of several key vitamins (i.e. vitamin B12, iron, folate). This leads to the signs and symptoms of autoimmune atrophic gastritis.;Autoimmune atrophic gastritis is a chronic inflammatory condition in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the cells of the stomach, leading to a decrease in the production of stomach acid and a gradual loss of the stomach lining. The exact cause of this autoimmune response is not fully understood, but it is believed to be triggered by a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors such as infections like H. pylori infection, certain medications, and dietary deficiencies. Additionally, some autoimmune diseases, such as pernicious anemia and type 1 diabetes, are associated with an increased risk of developing autoimmune atrophic gastritis.;0.092;60.0;90.0;0.342;0.129;0.256;0.872;0.161;0.238;0.083

In general, Alzheimer disease (AD) is a degenerative disease of the brain that causes gradual loss of memory, judgement and the ability to function socially. The exact underlying cause of late-onset familial AD is not completely understood; however, researchers suspect that it is a complex condition, which is likely associated with multiple susceptibility genes (such as the APOE e4 allele) in combination with environmental and lifestyle factors. Although complex conditions do tend to cluster in families, they do not follow a clear-cut pattern of inheritance. There is no cure for AD. Treatment is supportive and based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.";Late-Onset Familial Alzheimer Disease (LOAD) is a form of Alzheimer's disease that is caused by genetic factors and typically appears after the age of 65. It is the most common type of Alzheimer's disease, accounting for 60-80% of all cases. LOAD is caused by a combination of genetic mutations and environmental factors. The most common genetic mutations associated with LOAD are found in the amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2) genes. These mutations lead to the abnormal production and accumulation of amyloid beta plaques and tau tangles in the brain, which are the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease.;0.05;112.0;93.0;0.345;0.095;0.23;0.755;0.127;0.136;0.115

The name moyamoya means puff of smoke in Japanese and describes the look of the tangle of tiny vessels formed to compensate for the blockage. Moyamoya disease was first described in Japan in the 1960s and it has since been found in individuals in the other countries around the world; its incidence is higher in Asian countries than in Europe or North America. The disease primarily affects children, but it can also occur in adults. In children, the first symptom of Moyamoya disease is often stroke, or recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIA, commonly referred to as mini-strokes), frequently accompanied by muscular weakness or paralysis affecting one side of the body, or seizures. Adults may also experience these symptoms that arise from blocked arteries, but more often experience a hemorrhagic stroke due to bleeding into the brain from the abnormal brain vessels. Individuals with this disorder may have disturbed consciousness, problems with speaking and understanding speech, sensory and cognitive impairments, involuntary movements, and vision problems.About one in 10 individuals with Moyamoya disease has a close relative who is also affected; in these cases researchers think that Moyamoya disease is the result of inherited genetic abnormalities.Studies that look for the abnormal gene(s) may help reveal the biomechanisms that cause the disorder.";Moyamoya disease is a rare, progressive cerebrovascular disorder characterized by progressive narrowing of the major arteries at the base of the brain, resulting in insufficient blood flow to the brain. This narrowing is typically accompanied by the formation of abnormal new blood vessels, known as moyamoya vessels, which develop in an attempt to bypass the narrowed sections of the arteries and restore blood flow to the brain. The disease most commonly affects children and young adults, with a higher prevalence in East Asian populations. Symptoms of Moyamoya disease can include transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), strokes, seizures, headaches, and developmental delays in children.

Gordon syndrome belongs to a group of conditions known as the distal arthrogryposes, which are characterized by stiffness and impaired mobility of certain joints of the lower arms and legs including the wrists, elbows, knees and/or ankles. The range and severity of features in affected individuals can vary. Most infants with Gordon syndrome have several fingers that are permanently fixed in a flexed position (camptodactyly), which may result in limited range of motion and compromised manual dexterity. Affected infants may also have clubfoot. Approximately 20-30% have cleft palate (incomplete closure of the roof of the mouth). Other signs and symptoms in some individuals may include a bifid uvula (abnormal splitting of the soft hanging tissue at the back of the throat); short stature; dislocation of the hip; abnormal backward curvature of the upper spine (lordosis); and/or kyphoscoliosis. In addition, some affected individuals may have drooping of the eyelids (ptosis); epicanthal folds; syndactyly (webbing of the fingers and/or toes); abnormal skin patterns on the hands and feet (dermatoglyphics); and/or a short, webbed neck (pterygium colli). Some affected males have undescended testes (cryptorchidism). Cognitive development is typically normal.

If the tumor has not yet invaded surrounding nonpituitary tissues, removal of the pituitary adenoma by an experienced neurosurgeon is usually the first choice. Even if a cure is not possible, surgery may be performed if the patient has symptoms of neurological problems such as loss of peripheral vision or cranial nerve problems. After surgery, hormone levels are measured to determine whether a cure has been achieved. This determination can take up to 8 weeks because IGF-I lasts a long time in the body's circulation. If cured, a patient must be monitored for a long time for increasing GH levels.
                
If surgery does not normalize hormone levels or a relapse occurs, an endocrinologist should recommend additional drug therapy. With each medication, long-term therapy is necessary because their withdrawal can lead to rising GH levels and tumor re-expansion.
                
Radiation therapy is generally reserved for patients whose tumors are not completely removed by surgery, who are not good candidates for surgery because of other health problems, or who do not respond adequately to surgery and medication.";Acromegaly, characterized by excessive growth hormone production, can be treated with medications, surgery, or radiation therapy. Medications like somatostatin analogs (e.g., octreotide, lanreotide) or dopamine agonists (e.g., cabergoline, bromocriptine) can reduce growth hormone levels. Surgery, typically transsphenoidal surgery, aims to remove the pituitary tumor causing the hormone excess. Radiation therapy, specifically stereotactic radiosurgery, targets and destroys the pituitary tumor, gradually lowering hormone production.

661;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Bronchitis ?;"Espaol
                
Bronchitis (bron-KI-tis) is a condition in which the bronchial tubes become inflamed. These tubes carry air to your lungs. (For more information about the bronchial tubes and airways, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index How the Lungs Work article.)
                
People who have bronchitis often have a cough that brings up mucus. Mucus is a slimy substance made by the lining of the bronchial tubes. Bronchitis also may cause wheezing (a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe), chest pain or discomfort, a low fever, and shortness of breath.
                
Bronchitis
                

                
Overview
                
The two main types of bronchitis are acute (short term) and chronic (ongoing).
                
Acute Bronchitis
                
Infections or lung irritants cause acute bronchitis. The same viruses that cause colds and the flu are the most common cause of acute bronchitis. These viruses are spread through the air when people cough. They also are spread through physical contact (for example, on hands that have not been washed).
                
Sometimes bacteria cause acute bronchitis.
                
Acute bronchitis lasts from a few days to 10 days. However, coughing may last for several weeks after the infection is gone.
                
Several factors increase your risk for acute bronchitis. Examples include exposure to tobacco smoke (including secondhand smoke), dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. Avoiding these lung irritants as much as possible can help lower your risk for acute bronchitis.
                
Most cases of acute bronchitis go away within a few days. If you think you have acute bronchitis, see your doctor. He or she will want to rule out other, more serious health conditions that require medical care.
                
Chronic Bronchitis
                
Chronic bronchitis is an ongoing, serious condition. It occurs if the lining of the bronchial tubes is constantly irritated and inflamed, causing a long-term cough with mucus. Smoking is the main cause of chronic bronchitis.
                
Viruses or bacteria can easily infect the irritated bronchial tubes. If this happens, the condition worsens and lasts longer. As a result, people who have chronic bronchitis have periods when symptoms get much worse than usual.
                
Chronic bronchitis is a serious, long-term medical condition. Early diagnosis and treatment, combined with quitting smoking and avoiding secondhand smoke, can improve quality of life. The chance of complete recovery is low for people who have severe chronic bronchitis.";Bronchitis is a condition in which the bronchi, the airways that carry air to and from the lungs, become inflamed and produce excess mucus. This can make breathing difficult and cause a cough, which may produce mucus or phlegm. Bronchitis can be either acute, lasting for a short period of time, typically less than 3 weeks, or chronic, lasting for more than 3 months. Acute bronchitis is usually caused by a viral infection, while chronic bronchitis is often associated with long-term exposure to irritants such as tobacco smoke or air pollution. Treatment for bronchitis depends on the cause and severity of the condition and may include medications to relieve symptoms, antibiotics if a bacterial infection is present, and lifestyle changes to reduce exposure to irritants.;0.01;344.0;115.0;0.355;0.067;0.178;0.77;0.081;-0.037;0.202
662;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB ?;Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB (MPS IIIB) is an genetic disorder that makes the body unable to break down large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs, formerly called mucopolysaccharides). Specifically, people with this condition are unable to break down a GAG called heparan sulfate. Affected individuals can have severe neurological symptoms, including progressive dementia, aggressive behavior, hyperactivity, seizures, deafness, loss of vision, and an inability to sleep for more than a few hours at a time. MPS IIIB is caused by alterations (mutations) in the NAGLU gene. This gene provides the instructions for producing an enzyme called N-alpha-acetylglucosaminidase, which is needed to completely break down heparan sulfate. MPS IIIB is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. There is no specific treatment for this condition. Most people with MPS IIIB live into their teenage years, and some live longer.;Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB (MPS IIIB), also known as Sanfilippo syndrome type B, is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder that primarily affects the central nervous system. It is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU), which leads to the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in lysosomes, causing progressive damage to cells and tissues. MPS IIIB manifests with a range of symptoms, including delayed development, intellectual disability, behavioral problems, coarse facial features, skeletal abnormalities, and hearing loss. Treatment for MPS IIIB is supportive and aims to manage symptoms and improve the quality of life.

663;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is Felty's syndrome inherited ?;"Is Felty's syndrome inherited? It has not been concluded that Felty's syndrome is an inherited condition; most individuals with Felty's syndrome have not had a history of the condition in their family. However, there have been a few reports of the condition appearing to be familial. Furthermore, although the condition itself may not be inherited, some of the risk factors associated with Felty's syndrome may have genetic components. One study found that a family history of rheumatoid arthritis was more common in patients with Felty's syndrome and that there was a strong association with HLA-DR4 (an immune system gene common in individuals with RA). The authors also stated that there was an increased frequency of another gene as well, suggesting that certain other immune system genes may interact with HLA-DR4 and contribute to individuals developing Felty's syndrome. In another report, the authors described a family in which 3 siblings had Felty's syndrome.

664;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Niemann-Pick disease ?;"Niemann-Pick disease is a condition that affects many body systems. It has a wide range of symptoms that vary in severity. Niemann-Pick disease is divided into four main types: type A, type B, type C1, and type C2. These types are classified on the basis of genetic cause and the signs and symptoms of the condition.  Infants with Niemann-Pick disease type A usually develop an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly) by age 3 months and fail to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive). The affected children develop normally until around age 1 year when they experience a progressive loss of mental abilities and movement (psychomotor regression). Children with Niemann-Pick disease type A also develop widespread lung damage (interstitial lung disease) that can cause recurrent lung infections and eventually lead to respiratory failure. All affected children have an eye abnormality called a cherry-red spot, which can be identified with an eye examination. Children with Niemann-Pick disease type A generally do not survive past early childhood.  Niemann-Pick disease type B usually presents in mid-childhood. The signs and symptoms of this type are similar to type A, but not as severe. People with Niemann-Pick disease type B often have hepatosplenomegaly, recurrent lung infections, and a low number of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia). They also have short stature and slowed mineralization of bone (delayed bone age). About one-third of affected individuals have the cherry-red spot eye abnormality or neurological impairment. People with Niemann-Pick disease type B usually survive into adulthood.  The signs and symptoms of Niemann-Pick disease types C1 and C2 are very similar; these types differ only in their genetic cause. Niemann-Pick disease types C1 and C2 usually become apparent in childhood, although signs and symptoms can develop at any time. People with these types usually develop difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), an inability to move the eyes vertically (vertical supranuclear gaze palsy), poor muscle tone (dystonia), severe liver disease, and interstitial lung disease. Individuals with Niemann-Pick disease types C1 and C2 have problems with speech and swallowing that worsen over time, eventually interfering with feeding. Affected individuals often experience progressive decline in intellectual function and about one-third have seizures. People with these types may survive into adulthood.";Niemann-Pick disease is a rare, genetic lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the accumulation of harmful substances within cells, primarily affecting the spleen, liver, lungs, and brain. This buildup can lead to a range of symptoms, including an enlarged spleen and liver, yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), neurological problems, respiratory issues, and difficulty feeding and growing in infants. The disease is caused by mutations in genes involved in the metabolism and transport of lipids and cholesterol within cells, leading to the accumulation of these substances and subsequent cellular damage. Treatment options vary depending on the type of Niemann-Pick disease, but may include enzyme replacement therapy, medications to manage symptoms, and supportive care.;0.005;346.0;103.0;0.256;0.032;0.107;0.806;-0.118;-0.25;0.016

666;gemini-pro;causes;What causes Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency ?;"What causes carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency? Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency occurs when an enzyme, called ""carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase"" (CAT), is either missing or not working properly. This enzyme's job is to help change certain fats in the food we eat into energy. It also helps to break down fat already stored in the body. Energy from fat keeps us going whenever our bodies run low of their main source of energy, a type of sugar called glucose. Our bodies rely on fat for energy when we don't eat for a stretch of time - like when we miss a meal or when we sleep. When the CAT normal enzyme is missing or not working well, the body cannot use fat for energy, and must rely solely on glucose. Although glucose is a good source of energy, there is a limited amount available. Once the glucose has been used up, the body tries to use fat without success. This leads to low blood sugar, called hypoglycemia, and to the build up of harmful substances in the blood.";Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) deficiency is an inherited metabolic disorder characterized by an impaired transport of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) into mitochondria for energy production. This is due to mutations in the SLC25A20 gene, which encodes the CACT protein. The deficiency of CACT activity results in the accumulation of long-chain acylcarnitines in the blood and tissues, leading to a variety of clinical manifestations, including cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, liver dysfunction, and recurrent episodes of hypoketotic hypoglycemia. In severe cases, CACT deficiency can be fatal in infancy or early childhood.;0.008;158.0;79.0;0.194;0.028;0.142;0.635;-0.092;-0.074;-0.114
667;gemini-pro;symptoms;What are the symptoms of Kidney Disease ?;"Kidney Disease Kidney disease is often called a ""silent"" disease, because most people have no symptoms with early kidney disease. In fact, you might feel just fine until your kidneys have almost stopped working. Do NOT wait for symptoms! If you are at risk for kidney disease, talk to your health care provider about getting tested. (Watch the video to learn more about the symptoms of kidney disease. To enlarge the videos on this page, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner of the video screen. To reduce the videos, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.) Symptoms of Kidney Failure Kidney failure means that damaged kidneys are filtering less than 15% of the amount of blood filtered by healthy kidneys. If kidney disease progresses to kidney failure, a number of symptoms may occur. Some people experience fatigue, some lose their appetite, and some have leg cramps. These problems are caused by waste products that build up in the blood, a condition known as uremia. Healthy kidneys remove waste products from the blood. When the kidneys stop working, uremia occurs. The kidneys also make hormones and balance the minerals in the blood. When the kidneys stop working, most people develop conditions that affect the blood, bones, nerves, and skin. These problems may include itching, sleep problems, restless legs, weak bones, joint problems, and depression. How Kidney Disease Is Diagnosed  Blood and urine tests are the only way to check for kidney damage or measure kidney function. It is important for you to get checked for kidney disease if you have the key risk factors, which are - diabetes  - high blood pressure   - heart disease  - a family history of kidney failure.  diabetes high blood pressure heart disease a family history of kidney failure. If you are at risk, ask about your kidneys at your next medical appointment. The sooner you know you have kidney disease, the sooner you can get treatment to help delay or prevent kidney failure. If you have diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or a family history of kidney failure, you should get a blood and urine test to check your kidneys. Talk to your provider about how often you should be tested. (Watch the video to learn more about tests for kidney disease.) Blood Test The blood test checks your GFR. GFR stands for glomerular (glow-MAIR-you-lure) filtration rate. GFR is a measure of how much blood your kidneys filter each minute. This shows how well your kidneys are working. GFR is reported as a number. -  A GFR of 60 or higher is in the normal range.   - A GFR below 60 may mean you have kidney disease. However, because GFR decreases as people age, other information may be needed to determine if you actually have kidney disease.  - A GFR of 15 or lower may mean kidney failure.  A GFR of 60 or higher is in the normal range. A GFR below 60 may mean you have kidney disease. However, because GFR decreases as people age, other information may be needed to determine if you actually have kidney disease. A GFR of 15 or lower may mean kidney failure. You can't raise your GFR, but you can try to keep it from going lower. Ask your healthcare provider what you can do to keep your kidneys healthy.  Learn more about the GFR test. Urine Test The urine test looks for albumin (al-BYOO-min), a type of protein, in your urine. A healthy kidney does not let albumin pass into the urine. A damaged kidney lets some albumin pass into the urine. This test has several different names. You could be told that you are being screened for ""proteinuria"" or ""albuminuria"" or ""microalbuminuria."" Or you could be told that your ""urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio"" (UACR) is being measured. If you have albumin or protein in your urine, it could mean you have kidney disease. -  A urine albumin result below 30 is normal.  - A urine albumin result above 30 is not normal and may mean kidney disease. A urine albumin result below 30 is normal. A urine albumin result above 30 is not normal and may mean kidney disease. Learn more about the urine albumin test. Your healthcare provider might do additional tests to be sure.";The symptoms of kidney disease can vary depending on the stage and severity of the condition. In the early stages, there may be no noticeable symptoms. As the condition progresses, symptoms may include fatigue, weakness, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, swelling in the hands and feet, high blood pressure, shortness of breath, difficulty sleeping, muscle cramps, itchy skin, frequent urination, especially at night, and foamy or bubbly urine.

669;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia ?;Mutations in the TMPRSS6 gene cause iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called matriptase-2, which helps regulate iron levels in the body. TMPRSS6 gene mutations reduce or eliminate functional matriptase-2, which disrupts iron regulation and leads to a shortage of iron in the bloodstream. Iron is an essential component of hemoglobin, which is the molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen. When not enough iron is available in the bloodstream, less hemoglobin is produced, causing red blood cells to be abnormally small and pale. The abnormal cells cannot carry oxygen effectively to the body's cells and tissues, which leads to fatigue, weakness, and other symptoms of anemia.;Iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA) is an autosomal recessive disorder attributed to mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in cellular iron homeostasis. The most prevalent genetic alteration associated with IRIDA is a mutation in the gene TMPRSS6, which encodes the transmembrane protease serine 6. TMPRSS6 is involved in hepcidin regulation, a hormone that controls iron absorption and recycling. Mutations in TMPRSS6 lead to excessive hepcidin production, resulting in decreased iron absorption and impaired iron release from macrophages and hepatocytes. Other genetic changes linked to IRIDA include mutations in genes encoding proteins such as HFE2, SLC40A1, and FTH1, all of which play crucial roles in iron transport, regulation, and cellular iron utilization. These genetic variations collectively contribute to the impaired intestinal iron absorption and ineffective erythropoiesis observed in IRIDA.;0.042;104.0;121.0;0.225;0.059;0.141;0.739;0.08;0.117;0.041

Ongoing research is exploring potential therapies, including gene therapy and targeted drug treatments, to address the underlying cause of the condition and improve outcomes for individuals with Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome.;0.013;43.0;116.0;0.214;0.041;0.125;0.671;-0.023;-0.028;-0.021
680;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is Crohn disease inherited ?;The inheritance pattern of Crohn disease is unclear because many genetic and environmental factors are likely to be involved. This condition tends to cluster in families, however, and having an affected family member is a significant risk factor for the disease.;Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that can affect any part of the digestive tract. Although the exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown, it is believed to result from a combination of genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. Studies have shown that individuals with a family history of Crohn's disease have an increased risk of developing the condition, suggesting a genetic component to the disease. However, the inheritance pattern is complex and does not follow a simple Mendelian pattern, indicating that multiple genes and environmental factors are likely involved.;0.066;37.0;81.0;0.374;0.107;0.198;0.867;0.164;0.256;0.072

                    There are different types of treatment for children with Ewing sarcoma.
                    Different types of treatments are available for children with Ewing sarcoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.   Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Children with Ewing sarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.
                    Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with Ewing sarcoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists:         -  Pediatrician.    -  Surgical oncologist or orthopedic oncologist.    -  Radiation oncologist.    -  Pediatric nurse specialist.    -  Social worker.    -  Rehabilitation specialist.    -  Psychologist.
                
                
                    Treatment for Ewing sarcoma may cause side effects.
                    For information about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.    Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following:          - Physical problems.    - Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.    -  Second cancers (new types of cancer). Patients treated for Ewing sarcoma have an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. There is also an increased risk of sarcoma in the area treated with radiation therapy.        Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. (See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information.)
                
                
                    Five types of standard treatment are used:
                    Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug.    Systemic chemotherapy is part of the treatment for all patients with Ewing tumors. It is often the first treatment given and lasts for about 6 to 12 months. Chemotherapy is often given to shrink the tumor before surgery or radiation therapy and to kill any tumor cells that may have spread to other parts of the body.    See Drugs Approved for Soft Tissue Sarcoma for more information.       Radiation therapy    Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           External radiation therapy is used to treat Ewing sarcoma.    Radiation therapy is used when the tumor cannot be removed by surgery or when surgery to remove the tumor will affect important body functions or the way the child will look. It may be used to make the tumor smaller and decrease the amount of tissue that needs to be removed during surgery. It may also be used to treat any tumor that remains after surgery and tumors that have spread to other parts of the body.       Surgery    Surgery is usually done to remove cancer that is left after chemotherapy or radiation therapy. When possible, the whole tumor is removed by surgery. Tissue and bone that are removed may be replaced with a graft, which uses tissue and bone taken from another part of the patient's body or a donor. Sometimes an implant, such as artificial bone, is used.    Even if the doctor removes all of the cancer that can be seen at the time of the operation, chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be given after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Chemotherapy or radiation therapy given after surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back is called adjuvant therapy.        Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.     Monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy used in the treatment of recurrent Ewing sarcoma. It is being studied for the treatment of metastatic Ewing sarcoma. Monoclonal antibodies are made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.     New types of targeted therapy are being studied.            -  Kinase inhibitor therapy is another type of targeted therapy. Kinase inhibitors are drugs that block a protein needed for cancer cells to divide. They are being studied in the treatment of recurrent Ewing sarcoma.      -  PARP inhibitor therapy is another type of targeted therapy. PARP inhibitors are drugs that block DNA repair and may cause cancer cells to die. They are being studied in the treatment of recurrent Ewing sarcoma.              High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy to treat Ewing sarcoma and then replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient and are frozen and stored. After chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells. Chemotherapy with stem cell rescue is used to treat recurrent Ewing sarcoma.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy     CAR T-cell therapy is a type of immunotherapy that changes the patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells. T cells are taken from the patient and special receptors are added to their surface in the laboratory. The changed cells are called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells multiply in the patient's blood and attack cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapy is being studied in the treatment of Ewing sarcoma that has recurred.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

General information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.";Treatment for Ewing sarcoma typically involves a combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, and sometimes stem cell transplant. Chemotherapy drugs work to kill cancer cells throughout the body, while radiation therapy targets cancer cells in a specific area. Surgery is performed to remove the tumor and any affected lymph nodes. In some cases, stem cell transplant may be used to replace cells damaged by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Additionally, targeted therapy drugs, which block the growth and spread of cancer cells, may be used in combination with other treatments.;0.0;2053.0;84.0;0.164;0.039;0.128;0.72;-0.117;-0.278;0.051
682;gemini-pro;exams and tests;How to diagnose Glomerular Diseases ?;"Patients with glomerular disease have significant amounts of protein in the urine, which may be referred to as ""nephrotic range"" if levels are very high. Red blood cells in the urine are a frequent finding as well, particularly in some forms of glomerular disease. Urinalysis provides information about kidney damage by indicating levels of protein and red blood cells in the urine. Blood tests measure the levels of waste products such as creatinine and urea nitrogen to determine whether the filtering capacity of the kidneys is impaired. If these lab tests indicate kidney damage, the doctor may recommend ultrasound or an x ray to see whether the shape or size of the kidneys is abnormal. These tests are called renal imaging. But since glomerular disease causes problems at the cellular level, the doctor will probably also recommend a kidney biopsya procedure in which a needle is used to extract small pieces of tissue for examination with different types of microscopes, each of which shows a different aspect of the tissue. A biopsy may be helpful in confirming glomerular disease and identifying the cause.";"Glomerular diseases are a group of kidney disorders that affect the glomeruli, which are small filters in the kidneys that help remove waste products from the blood. Diagnosis typically involves a combination of tests, including:

* **Urinalysis:** This test checks for abnormal levels of protein, blood, and other substances in the urine, which can indicate glomerular damage.

* **Blood tests:** Blood tests can measure levels of creatinine, urea, and other substances that can be elevated in glomerular diseases. Blood tests can also be used to check for antibodies associated with certain glomerular diseases.

* **Imaging tests:** Imaging tests, such as ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scans, can provide detailed images of the kidneys and help identify structural abnormalities or blockages.

* **Kidney biopsy:** In some cases, a kidney biopsy may be necessary to obtain a sample of kidney tissue for examination under a microscope. This can help determine the specific type of glomerular disease and guide treatment decisions.";0.05;164.0;143.0;0.425;0.129;0.238;0.902;0.256;0.242;0.268
683;gemini-pro;symptoms;What are the symptoms of Huntington disease ?;What are the signs and symptoms of Huntington disease? Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive disorder that causes motor, cognitive, and psychiatric signs and symptoms. On average, most people begin developing features of HD between ages 35 and 44. Signs and symptoms vary by stage and may include: Early stage: Behavioral disturbances Clumsiness Moodiness Irritability Paranoia Apathy Anxiety Hallucinations Abnormal eye movements Depression Impaired ability to detect odors Middle stage: Dystonia Involuntary movements Trouble with balance and walking Chorea with twisting and writhing motions Unsteady gait (style of walking) Slow reaction time General weakness Weight loss Speech difficulties Stubbornness Late stage: Rigidity (continual tension of the muscles) Bradykinesia (difficulty initiating and continuing movements) Severe chorea Serious weight loss Inability to speak Inability to walk Swallowing problems Inability to care for oneself There is also a less common, early-onset form of HD which begins in childhood or adolescence. For more information on this form, please visit GARD's juvenile Huntington disease Web page. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Huntington disease. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.;Huntington disease is a progressive brain disorder that leads to deterioration of motor coordination, cognitive abilities, and eventually, psychiatric disturbances. Symptoms typically manifest between 30 and 50 years of age. Early signs include subtle changes in mood, behavior, and cognition. As the disease progresses, individuals may experience involuntary movements, muscle rigidity, difficulty with balance and coordination, speech impairment, difficulty swallowing, and cognitive decline. Psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, irritability, and apathy are also common. In the later stages of the disease, individuals may become completely dependent on caregivers for all activities of daily living.;0.001;390.0;91.0;0.28;0.027;0.177;0.827;-0.073;-0.292;0.164

This means that both copies of the gene responsible for CHMCS, one inherited from each parent, must be mutated in order for an individual to develop the disorder. In some cases, CHMCS can also be caused by de novo mutations, which are new mutations that occur spontaneously and are not inherited from either parent.;0.093;44.0;66.0;0.506;0.132;0.322;0.582;0.203;0.359;0.054
685;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) autosomal recessive primary microcephaly ?;"Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (often shortened to MCPH, which stands for ""microcephaly primary hereditary"") is a condition in which infants are born with a very small head and a small brain. The term ""microcephaly"" comes from the Greek words for ""small head.""  Infants with MCPH have an unusually small head circumference compared to other infants of the same sex and age. Head circumference is the distance around the widest part of the head, measured by placing a measuring tape above the eyebrows and ears and around the back of the head. Affected infants' brain volume is also smaller than usual, although they usually do not have any major abnormalities in the structure of the brain. The head and brain grow throughout childhood and adolescence, but they continue to be much smaller than normal.  MCPH causes intellectual disability, which is typically mild to moderate and does not become more severe with age. Most affected individuals have delayed speech and language skills. Motor skills, such as sitting, standing, and walking, may also be mildly delayed.  People with MCPH usually have few or no other features associated with the condition. Some have a narrow, sloping forehead; mild seizures; problems with attention or behavior; or short stature compared to others in their family. The condition typically does not affect any other major organ systems or cause other health problems.";Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH), a genetically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder, is characterized by a head circumference that is significantly smaller than expected for age and sex. With an estimated prevalence of 1 in 25,000, MCPH is typically caused by mutations in genes involved in DNA repair, centrosome function, and mitotic progression, leading to impaired neurogenesis and abnormal neuronal migration during fetal brain development. This results in a smaller brain size and varying degrees of intellectual disability, ranging from mild to severe. Additional features may include seizures, speech and language difficulties, and motor coordination problems.;0.019;205.0;90.0;0.335;0.07;0.223;0.828;0.005;-0.04;0.048

687;gemini-pro;symptoms;What are the symptoms of Arts syndrome ?;What are the signs and symptoms of Arts syndrome? Boys with Arts syndrome have sensorineural hearing loss, which is a complete or almost complete loss of hearing caused by abnormalities in the inner ear. Other features include weak muscle tone (hypotonia), impaired muscle coordination (ataxia), developmental delay, and intellectual disability. In early childhood, affected boys develop vision loss caused by degeneration of the nerves that carry information from the eyes to the brain (optic atrophy). They also experience loss of sensation and weakness in the limbs (peripheral neuropathy).   Boys with Arts syndrome also have problems with their immune system that lead to recurrent infections, especially involving the respiratory system. Because of these infections and their complications, affected boys often do not survive past early childhood.  Females can also be affected by Arts syndrome, but they typically have much milder symptoms. In some cases, hearing loss that begins in adulthood may be the only symptom.

688;gemini-pro;causes;What causes Lung Cancer ?;Some studies suggest that non-smokers who are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke, also called secondhand smoke, are at increased risk of lung cancer. Secondhand smoke is the smoke that non-smokers are exposed to when they share air space with someone who is smoking. Tobacco smoke contains more than 7,000 chemicals, including hundreds that are toxic and about 70 that can cause cancer. Since 1964, approximately 2,500,000 nonsmokers have died from health problems caused by exposure to secondhand smoke.  Learn more about the effects of secondhand smoke.  Learn more about the chemicals found in cigarettes.;Lung cancer is primarily caused by prolonged exposure to carcinogens, substances that can damage DNA and lead to uncontrolled cell growth. Cigarette smoking, which involves inhaling tobacco smoke containing numerous carcinogens, is the leading cause of lung cancer. Exposure to secondhand smoke, radon gas, asbestos, certain chemicals like arsenic and beryllium, air pollution, and a family history of lung cancer can also contribute to lung cancer development.

Currently, there is not a cure for scleroderma, however treatments are available to relieve symptoms and limit damage. Treatment will vary depending on your symptoms.;Scleroderma, an autoimmune disease that affects the skin and internal organs, has a range of potential treatments to manage its symptoms and slow disease progression. Immunosuppressive medications, such as methotrexate, azathioprine, and cyclosporine, are often used to suppress the overactive immune response. Corticosteroids like prednisone may be prescribed to reduce inflammation. For skin involvement, topical treatments such as creams or gels containing corticosteroids, retinoids, or calcipotriene may be beneficial. In cases of severe skin involvement, phototherapy or laser therapy may be recommended. Pulmonary arterial hypertension, a potential complication of scleroderma, can be managed with medications such as endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, or prostacyclin analogs. For interstitial lung disease, medications like pirfenidone or nintedanib may be prescribed.

It is characterized by melanocytic nevi in both the skin and the brain. Two-thirds of people with NCM have giant congenital melanocytic nevi, and the remaining one-third have numerous lesions but no giant lesions. Most patients present with neurological features early in life, which can be secondary to intracranial hemorrhages (bleeding in the brain), impairment of cerebrospinal fluid circulation (fluid around the brain and spinal cord), and/or malignant transformation of the melanocytes. The prognosis of patients with symptomatic neurocutaneous melanosis is extremely poor, even in the absence of malignancy. Chemotherapy has been ineffective in the few patients in whom it has been tried.;Neurocutaneous melanosis is a rare disorder characterized by the presence of abnormal pigment cells (melanocytes) in the brain, spinal cord, and skin. It is often associated with the formation of benign and malignant tumors in the central nervous system, eyes, and skin. Symptoms of neurocutaneous melanosis can vary depending on the location and extent of the melanocytic lesions, and may include seizures, headaches, vision problems, skin discoloration, and neurological deficits. Treatment typically involves surgical removal of tumors, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, although the prognosis of neurocutaneous melanosis can vary widely.;0.042;105.0;82.0;0.391;0.114;0.195;0.804;0.158;0.048;0.27

Other features include progressive nearsightedness (myopia), degeneration of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retinal dystrophy), an unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility), and distinctive facial features. Characteristic facial features include thick hair and eyebrows, long eyelashes, unusually-shaped eyes (down-slanting and wave-shaped), a bulbous nasal tip, a smooth or shortened area between the nose and the upper lip (philtrum), and prominent upper central teeth. The combination of the last two facial features results in an open-mouth appearance.  The features of Cohen syndrome vary widely among affected individuals. Additional signs and symptoms in some individuals with this disorder include low levels of white blood cells (neutropenia), overly friendly behavior, and obesity that develops in late childhood or adolescence. When obesity is present, it typically develops around the torso, with the arms and legs remaining slender. Individuals with Cohen syndrome may also have narrow hands and feet, and slender fingers.;Cohen syndrome is a rare genetic condition characterized by intellectual disability, a distinctive facial appearance, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and delayed growth. It is caused by mutations in the COH1 gene, which is located on chromosome 8. Cohen syndrome is typically diagnosed based on clinical findings and genetic testing.

JEB is separated into two categories: the Herlitz type and the Non-Herlitz type. The Herlitz type of JEB is very severe, and individuals with this condition often do not survive infancy. The Non-Herlitz type includes several subtypes that cause mild to severe blistering of the skin present at birth or shortly thereafter.   JEB is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. It is caused by mutations in the LAMB3, COL17A1, or LAMC2, and LAMA3 genes.There is no cure for JEB. Treatment is focused on management of blistering and prevention of secondary infections.;Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) is a rare genetic skin disorder characterized by the formation of blisters and erosions at the junction between the epidermis and dermis layers of the skin. This results in fragile skin that is easily damaged, leading to blistering and scarring. JEB is caused by mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in the adhesion of the epidermis to the dermis. The severity of JEB can vary widely, ranging from mild cases with occasional blistering to severe cases with extensive blistering and scarring. Treatment for JEB typically focuses on preventing and managing complications, such as infection and scarring, and may include wound care, pain management, and genetic counseling.;0.104;108.0;102.0;0.383;0.133;0.284;0.912;0.188;0.111;0.264

697;gemini-pro;causes;What causes Trisomy 17 mosaicism ?;"What causes trisomy 17 mosaicism? Trisomy 17 mosaicism can arise due to errors in cell division that occur after conception. For example, at the time of conception, the fetus may actually have trisomy 17 in all of its cells; however, during cell division, some of the cells lose the extra chromosome 17. Alternatively, the fetus may initially have had only two copies of chromosome 17, but due to errors in cell division some of the cells end up with an extra copy of chromosome 17. Either of these two scenarios result in trisomy 17 mosaicism. To read more about trisomy mosaicism, visit the following links from the Medical Genetics Department at the University of British Columbia in Canada. What is mosaicism?  How does trisomy mosaicism occur?";Trisomy 17 mosaicism, a rare genetic condition, occurs when an individual has an extra copy of chromosome 17 in some of their cells. The exact cause of this chromosomal abnormality is not fully understood, but it is believed to arise from errors during cell division. These errors can happen during the formation of sperm or eggs (meiosis) or in the early stages of embryonic development (mitosis). In some cases, trisomy 17 mosaicism may be caused by the translocation of genetic material from chromosome 17 to another chromosome. This translocation can occur spontaneously or be inherited from a parent carrying a balanced translocation involving chromosome 17.;0.078;116.0;96.0;0.348;0.108;0.197;0.903;0.141;0.149;0.13

However, not everyone who inherits hemochromatosis genes develops symptoms or complications of the disease. In those who do, treatments can keep the disease from getting worse.
                
Treatments include therapeutic phlebotomy, iron chelation therapy, dietary changes, and other treatments. For more information, go to ""How Is Hemochromatosis Treated?""
                
People who have hemochromatosis (or a family history of it) and are planning to have children may want to consider genetic testing and counseling. Testing will help show whether one or both parents have faulty HFE genes. A genetic counselor also can help figure out the likelihood of the parents passing the faulty genes on to their children.";"Preventing hemochromatosis typically involves managing iron intake and absorption:

- **Diet:** Limit consumption of iron-rich foods like red meat, organ meats, and certain seafood.

- **Supplements:** Avoid iron supplements unless prescribed by a healthcare provider.

- **Blood Donation:** Regular blood donation can help reduce iron levels in the body.

- **Chelation Therapy:** In severe cases, chelation therapy may be used to remove excess iron from the bloodstream.

- **Genetic Screening:** Individuals with a family history of hemochromatosis should undergo genetic testing to determine their risk.";0.025;105.0;76.0;0.246;0.056;0.174;0.705;0.061;0.064;0.054

Individuals with this condition typically begin to develop signs and symptoms within the first few years of life. Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis is characterized by skin bumps that frequently appear on the hands, neck, scalp, ears, and nose. These skin bumps can also develop in joint creases and the genital region. They vary in size and are sometimes painful. Affected individuals usually develop more skin bumps over time.  Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis is also characterized by overgrowth of the gums (gingival hypertrophy) and joint deformities (contractures) that can impair movement. In addition, affected individuals may grow slowly and have bone abnormalities. People with juvenile hyaline fibromatosis typically have severe physical limitations, but most individuals have normal intelligence and live into adulthood.;Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (JHF) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the gene encoding the enzyme lysyl hydroxylase 3 (LH3). This enzyme is involved in the cross-linking of collagen, a protein that provides strength and structure to connective tissues. The mutation in LH3 leads to a deficiency of this enzyme, resulting in the accumulation of immature collagen fibers in various tissues, particularly in the skin, subcutaneous tissue, fascia, and joints. This accumulation of immature collagen fibers causes the formation of firm, rubbery masses or nodules, which can cause pain, swelling, and restricted movement in affected areas. Additionally, JHF can also affect internal organs such as the lungs, kidneys, and heart, leading to various complications.;0.021;126.0;106.0;0.228;0.038;0.165;0.709;0.005;0.065;-0.057

It generally occurs incidentally due to trauma, chronic inflammation and/or prolonged compression of the airways.;Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) is a condition characterized by the softening and weakening of the walls of the trachea and bronchi, leading to collapse of the airways during respiration. Inherited forms of TBM are rare, with only a few families reported to have multiple affected members. The inheritance pattern in these families suggests an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the condition. However, the majority of TBM cases are acquired and not inherited, being caused by factors such as prolonged mechanical ventilation, tracheal intubation, or chronic inflammatory conditions.;0.032;84.0;86.0;0.292;0.048;0.185;0.919;0.145;0.145;0.143

The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Absence of Tibia. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Absent tibia - Autosomal recessive inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.;Absence of Tibia, also known as congenital tibial agenesis, manifests symptoms ranging from minor limb shortening to severe deformity. Affected individuals may have a shortened or absent tibia bone, which is the larger bone in the lower leg. This can lead to an inward curvature of the affected leg (tibial bowing), a prominent fibula (the smaller bone in the lower leg), and a dislocated ankle joint. In some cases, the foot may be rotated inward or outward. Additional symptoms can include muscle atrophy, limited range of motion, and difficulty walking. In severe cases, the affected limb may be amputated to improve mobility and prevent complications. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are essential for managing the symptoms of Absence of Tibia.;0.029;202.0;108.0;0.231;0.043;0.143;0.513;-0.192;-0.244;-0.143
708;gemini-pro;treatment;What are the treatments for Acromegaly ?;"Currently, treatment options include surgical removal of the tumor, medical therapy, and radiation therapy of the pituitary.
                
Goals of treatment are to
                
- reduce excess hormone production to normal levels  - relieve the pressure that the growing pituitary tumor may be exerting on the surrounding brain areas  - preserve normal pituitary function or treat hormone deficiencies  - improve the symptoms of acromegaly
                
Surgery
                
Surgery is the first option recommended for most people with acromegaly, as it is often a rapid and effective treatment. The surgeon reaches the pituitary via an incision through the nose or inside the upper lip and, with special tools, removes the tumor tissue in a procedure called transsphenoidal surgery. This procedure promptly relieves the pressure on the surrounding brain regions and leads to a rapid lowering of GH levels. If the surgery is successful, facial appearance and soft tissue swelling improve within a few days.
                
Surgery is most successful in patients with blood GH levels below 45 ng/ml before the operation and with pituitary tumors no larger than 10 millimeters (mm) in diameter. Success depends in large part on the skill and experience of the surgeon, as well as the location of the tumor. Even with the most experienced neurosurgeon, the chance of a cure is small if the tumor has extended into critical brain structures or into the cavernous sinus where surgery could be risky.
                
The success rate also depends on what level of GH is defined as a cure. The best measure of surgical success is normalization of GH and IGF-I levels. The overall rate of remission-control of the disease-after surgery ranges from 55 to 80 percent. (See For More Information to locate a board-certified neurosurgeon.)
                
A possible complication of surgery is damage to the surrounding normal pituitary tissue, which requires lifelong use of pituitary hormone replacement. The part of the pituitary that stores antidiuretic hormonea hormone important in water balancemay be temporarily or, rarely, permanently damaged and the patient may require medical therapy. Other potential problems include cerebrospinal fluid leaks and, rarely, meningitis. Cerebrospinal fluid bathes the brain and can leak from the nose if the incision area doesnt heal well. Meningitis is a bacterial or viral infection of the meninges, the outer covering of the brain.
                
Even when surgery is successful and hormone levels return to normal, people with acromegaly must be carefully monitored for years for possible recurrence of the disease. More commonly, hormone levels improve, but do not return to normal. Additional treatment, usually medications, may be required.
                
Medical Therapy
                
Medical therapy is most often used if surgery does not result in a cure and sometimes to shrink large tumors before surgery. Three medication groups are used to treat acromegaly.
                
Somatostatin analogs (SSAs) are the first medication group used to treat acromegaly. They shut off GH production and are effective in lowering GH and IGF-I levels in 50 to 70 percent of patients. SSAs also reduce tumor size in around 0 to 50 percent of patients but only to a modest degree. Several studies have shown that SSAs are safe and effective for long-term treatment and in treating patients with acromegaly caused by nonpituitary tumors. Long-acting SSAs are given by intramuscular injection once a month.
                
Digestive problems-such as loose stools, nausea, and gas-are a side effect in about half of people taking SSAs. However, the effects are usually temporary and rarely severe. About 10 to 20 percent of patients develop gallstones, but the gallstones do not usually cause symptoms. In rare cases, treatment can result in elevated blood glucose levels. More commonly, SSAs reduce the need for insulin and improve blood glucose control in some people with acromegaly who already have diabetes.
                
The second medication group is the GH receptor antagonists (GHRAs), which interfere with the action of GH. They normalize IGF-I levels in more than 90 percent of patients. They do not, however, lower GH levels. Given once a day through injection, GHRAs are usually well-tolerated by patients. The long-term effects of these drugs on tumor growth are still under study. Side effects can include headaches, fatigue, and abnormal liver function.
                
Dopamine agonists make up the third medication group. These drugs are not as effective as the other medications at lowering GH or IGF-I levels, and they normalize IGF-I levels in only a minority of patients. Dopamine agonists are sometimes effective in patients who have mild degrees of excess GH and have both acromegaly and hyperprolactinemiatoo much of the hormone prolactin. Dopamine agonists can be used in combination with SSAs. Side effects can include nausea, headache, and lightheadedness.
                
Agonist: A drug that binds to a receptor of a cell and triggers a response by the cell, mimicking the action of a naturally occurring substance.   Antagonist: A chemical that acts within the body to reduce the physiological activity of another chemical substance or hormone.
                
Radiation Therapy
                
Radiation therapy is usually reserved for people who have some tumor remaining after surgery and do not respond to medications. Because radiation leads to a slow lowering of GH and IGF-I levels, these patients often also receive medication to lower hormone levels. The full effect of this therapy may not occur for many years.
                
The two types of radiation delivery are conventional and stereotactic. Conventional radiation delivery targets the tumor with external beams but can damage surrounding tissue. The treatment delivers small doses of radiation multiple times over 4 to 6 weeks, giving normal tissue time to heal between treatments.
                
Stereotactic delivery allows precise targeting of a high-dose beam of radiation at the tumor from varying angles. The patient must wear a rigid head frame to keep the head still. The types of stereotactic radiation delivery currently available are proton beam, linear accelerator (LINAC), and gamma knife. With stereotactic delivery, the tumor must be at least 5 mm from the optic chiasm to prevent radiation damage. This treatment can sometimes be done in a single session, reducing the risk of damage to surrounding tissue.
                
All forms of radiation therapy cause a gradual decline in production of other pituitary hormones over time, resulting in the need for hormone replacement in most patients. Radiation also can impair a patients fertility. Vision loss and brain injury are rare complications. Rarely, secondary tumors can develop many years later in areas that were in the path of the radiation beam.";Acromegaly, characterized by excessive growth hormone production, is primarily managed with medications or surgical interventions. Medications commonly used include somatostatin analogues like octreotide or lanreotide, which suppress growth hormone secretion. Dopamine agonists like cabergoline or bromocriptine can also be effective in reducing growth hormone levels. In cases of medication resistance or tumors causing the condition, surgical removal of the pituitary tumor via transsphenoidal surgery is the preferred treatment. Radiation therapy may be employed post-surgery to prevent tumor recurrence. Additional treatments may target symptoms or complications, such as managing blood pressure, regulating glucose levels, or correcting vision problems.;0.0;951.0;94.0;0.214;0.034;0.105;0.674;-0.088;-0.206;0.033
709;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) color vision deficiency ?;Color vision deficiency (sometimes called color blindness) represents a group of conditions that affect the perception of color. Red-green color vision defects are the most common form of color vision deficiency. Affected individuals have trouble distinguishing between some shades of red, yellow, and green. Blue-yellow color vision defects (also called tritan defects), which are rarer, cause problems with differentiating shades of blue and green and cause difficulty distinguishing dark blue from black. These two forms of color vision deficiency disrupt color perception but do not affect the sharpness of vision (visual acuity).  A less common and more severe form of color vision deficiency called blue cone monochromacy causes very poor visual acuity and severely reduced color vision. Affected individuals have additional vision problems, which can include increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), involuntary back-and-forth eye movements (nystagmus), and nearsightedness (myopia). Blue cone monochromacy is sometimes considered to be a form of achromatopsia, a disorder characterized by a partial or total lack of color vision with other vision problems.;Color vision deficiency, also known as color blindness, is a common condition in which individuals have difficulty distinguishing between certain colors. This is typically caused by a lack or malfunction of certain types of cone cells in the retina, which are responsible for detecting different colors of light. The most common type of color vision deficiency is red-green color blindness, which affects the ability to distinguish between red and green hues. Other types include blue-yellow color blindness, which affects the ability to distinguish between blue and yellow hues, and complete color blindness, which is very rare and results in the inability to perceive any colors at all.;0.038;159.0;100.0;0.416;0.118;0.221;0.874;0.187;0.087;0.288

In adults, the foods that most often trigger allergic reactions include fish, shellfish, peanuts, and tree nuts, such as walnuts. Problem foods for children can include eggs, milk, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, and wheat.    The allergic reaction may be mild. In rare cases it can cause a severe reaction called anaphylaxis. Symptoms of food allergy include       - Itching or swelling in your mouth    - Vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal cramps and pain    - Hives or eczema    - Tightening of the throat and trouble breathing    - Drop in blood pressure       Your health care provider may use a detailed history, elimination diet, and skin and blood tests to diagnose a food allergy.    When you have food allergies, you must be prepared to treat an accidental exposure. Wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace, and carry an auto-injector device containing epinephrine (adrenaline).    You can only prevent the symptoms of food allergy by avoiding the food. After you and your health care provider have identified the foods to which you are sensitive, you must remove them from your diet.    NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases;Food allergies occur when the body's immune system mistakenly identifies certain food proteins as harmful and overreacts to them. This reaction can range from mild symptoms like hives or digestive issues to severe and potentially life-threatening ones such as anaphylaxis.

714;gemini-pro;exams and tests;How to diagnose Diabetic mastopathy ?;How is diabetic mastopathy diagnosed? The diagnosis of diabetic mastopathy should be considered in patients with long-standing insulin-dependent diabetes and a firm, mobile breast mass. Initial imaging may include mammography and ultrasound. While these methods can help to further differentiate the mass, they cannot provide a specific diagnosis of diabetic mastopathy with confident exclusion of malignancy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is unlikely to add additional information. Current practice dictates that a core biopsy (utilizing a needle to remove a small cylinder of tissue) be performed for a definitive diagnosis.  Biopsy results demonstrate lymphocytic lobulitis and ductitis, glandular atrophy (wasting), perivascular inflammation (vasculitis), dense keloid fibrosis (scarring), and epithelioid fibroblasts.;"Diagnosing diabetic mastopathy involves a comprehensive approach that includes:

1. **Medical History and Physical Examination:** A detailed medical history, including a focus on diabetes control, duration, and any associated symptoms, is essential. Physical examination of the breasts may reveal diffuse enlargement, tenderness, or nodularity.

2. **Imaging Studies:** Mammography, ultrasound, and MRI can aid in evaluating breast tissue and detecting any abnormalities. Mammography may show increased density or asymmetry, while ultrasound can help differentiate between solid and cystic lesions. MRI can provide detailed images of the breasts and identify areas of concern.

3. **Fine-Needle Aspiration (FNA) or Core Needle Biopsy:** If suspicious lesions are detected on imaging studies, a tissue sample may be obtained through FNA or core needle biopsy for further examination under a microscope. This helps determine the nature of the lesion, whether it's benign or malignant.

4. **Laboratory Tests:** Blood tests, such as fasting blood sugar and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), can assess diabetes control and monitor the overall health status of the patient.

5. **Hormonal Evaluation:** In some cases, hormonal imbalances associated with diabetes may contribute to breast changes. Hormone levels, including estrogen, progesterone, and prolactin, may be checked to assess their role in breast abnormalities.

A combination of these diagnostic methods helps healthcare providers accurately diagnose diabetic mastopathy and determine the appropriate management approach.";0.01;101.0;204.0;0.274;0.014;0.164;0.794;-0.044;-0.005;-0.086
715;gemini-pro;information;Do you have information about Antioxidants;Summary : Antioxidants are man-made or natural substances that may prevent or delay some types of cell damage. Antioxidants are found in many foods, including fruits and vegetables. They are also available as dietary supplements. Examples of antioxidants include       -  Beta-carotene     -  Lutein     -  Lycopene    -  Selenium    -  Vitamin A    -  Vitamin C    -  Vitamin E       Vegetables and fruits are rich sources of antioxidants. There is good evidence that eating a diet with lots of vegetables and fruits is healthy and lowers risks of certain diseases. But it isn't clear whether this is because of the antioxidants, something else in the foods, or other factors.    High-dose supplements of antioxidants may be linked to health risks in some cases. For example, high doses of beta-carotene may increase the risk of lung cancer in smokers. High doses of vitamin E may increase risks of prostate cancer and one type of stroke. Antioxidant supplements may also interact with some medicines. To minimize risk, tell you of your health care providers about any antioxidants you use.

719;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome ?;Mutations in the DHCR7 gene cause Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome.  The DHCR7 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase. This enzyme is responsible for the final step in the production of cholesterol. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that is produced in the body and obtained from foods that come from animals (particularly egg yolks, meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products). Cholesterol is necessary for normal embryonic development and has important functions both before and after birth. It is a structural component of cell membranes and the protective substance covering nerve cells (myelin). Additionally, cholesterol plays a role in the production of certain hormones and digestive acids.  Mutations in the DHCR7 gene reduce or eliminate the activity of 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, preventing cells from producing enough cholesterol. A lack of this enzyme also allows potentially toxic byproducts of cholesterol production to build up in the blood, nervous system, and other tissues. The combination of low cholesterol levels and an accumulation of other substances likely disrupts the growth and development of many body systems. It is not known, however, how this disturbance in cholesterol production leads to the specific features of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome.;Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the DHCR7 gene, which encodes an enzyme called 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase. This enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of cholesterol, a molecule that plays a vital role in various cellular processes. Mutations in the DHCR7 gene lead to a deficiency of cholesterol and an accumulation of its precursor, 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC).

A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.    Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Children with brain stem glioma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood brain tumors.
                    Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with brain tumors and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists:         -  Pediatrician.    -  Neurosurgeon.    -  Neuropathologist.    -  Radiation oncologist.    -  Neuro-oncologist.    -  Neurologist.    -  Rehabilitation specialist.    -  Neuroradiologist.    -  Endocrinologist.    -  Psychologist.
                
                
                    Childhood brain stem gliomas may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years.
                    Childhood brain stem gliomas may cause signs or symptoms that continue for months or years. Signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before diagnosis. Signs or symptoms caused by treatment may begin during or right after treatment.
                
                
                    Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.
                    These are called late effects. Late effects may include the following:         - Physical problems.    - Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.    -  Second cancers (new types of cancer).        Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. (See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information).
                
                
                    Six types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery      Surgery may be used to diagnose and treat childhood brain stem glioma as discussed in the General Information section of this summary.        Radiation therapy      Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:             -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.             The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat DIPG. External and/or internal radiation therapy may be used to treat focal brain stem gliomas.     Several months after radiation therapy to the brain, imaging tests may show changes to the brain tissue. These changes may be caused by the radiation therapy or may mean the tumor is growing. It is important to be sure the tumor is growing before any more treatment is given.       Chemotherapy      Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly in the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated.     Because radiation therapy to the brain can affect growth and brain development in young children, clinical trials are studying ways of using chemotherapy to delay or reduce the need for radiation therapy.       Cerebrospinal fluid diversion     Cerebrospinal fluid diversion is a method used to drain fluid that has built up in the brain. A shunt (long, thin tube) is placed in a ventricle (fluid-filled space) of the brain and threaded under the skin to another part of the body, usually the abdomen. The shunt carries extra fluid away from the brain so it may be absorbed elsewhere in the body.          Observation     Observation is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change.       Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.     Some focal brain stem gliomas that cannot be removed by surgery may be treated with BRAF kinase inhibitor therapy. BRAF kinase inhibitors block the BRAF protein. BRAF proteins help control cell growth and may be mutated (changed) in some types of brain stem glioma. Blocking mutated BRAF kinase proteins may help keep cancer cells from growing.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.   If the results of imaging tests done after treatment show a mass in the brain, a biopsy may be done to find out if it is made up of dead tumor cells or if new cancer cells are growing. In children who are expected to live a long time, regular MRIs may be done to see if the cancer has come back.

						                    Newly Diagnosed Childhood Brain Stem Glioma
						                    Newly diagnosed childhood brain stem glioma is a tumor for which no treatment has been given. The child may have received drugs or treatment to relieve signs or symptoms caused by the tumor.       Standard treatment of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) may include the following:            -  Radiation therapy.     -  Chemotherapy (in infants).               Standard treatment of focal glioma may include the following:            -  Surgery that may be followed by chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.     -  Observation for small tumors that grow slowly. Cerebrospinal fluid diversion may be done when there is extra fluid in the brain.     -  Internal radiation therapy with radioactive seeds, with or without chemotherapy, when the tumor cannot be removed by surgery.     -  Targeted therapy with a BRAF kinase inhibitor, for certain tumors that cannot be removed by surgery.               Treatment of brain stem glioma in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 may be observation. The tumors are slow-growing in these children and may not need specific treatment for years.     Check the list of NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with untreated childhood brain stem glioma. For more specific results, refine the search by using other search features, such as the location of the trial, the type of treatment, or the name of the drug.

						                    Progressive or Recurrent Childhood Brain Stem Glioma
						                    When cancer does not get better with treatment or comes back, palliative care is an important part of the child's treatment plan. It includes physical, psychological, social, and spiritual support for the child and family. The goal of palliative care is to help control symptoms and give the child the best quality of life possible. Parents may not be sure about whether to continue treatment or what kind of treatment is best for their child. The healthcare team can give parents information to help them make these decisions.      There is no standard treatment for progressive or recurrent diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. The child may be treated in a clinical trial of a new treatment.         Treatment of recurrent focal childhood brain stem glioma may include the following:            - A second surgery to remove the tumor.     -  External radiation therapy.     -  Chemotherapy.     - A clinical trial of a new treatment.            Check the list of NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with recurrent childhood brain stem glioma.

Talk with your child's doctor about clinical trials that may be right for your child. General information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.";Childhood brain stem glioma, a rare and aggressive type of brain cancer, presents unique challenges in treatment due to its location in the brainstem, which controls vital functions. Treatment options are limited and complex, often involving a combination of approaches. The primary treatment modality is radiation therapy, which can be delivered through external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or brachytherapy (implantation of radioactive seeds). Chemotherapy, with drugs like carboplatin, vincristine, and temozolomide, is also commonly used. Targeted therapy, using drugs that specifically target cancer cells, such as erlotinib and crizotinib, may be an option in certain cases. Additionally, supportive care, including steroids to reduce inflammation and anticonvulsants to control seizures, plays a crucial role in managing symptoms and improving quality of life. Surgery is generally not an option due to the tumor's location. Clinical trials exploring newer treatment approaches and combinations are ongoing to improve outcomes for children with this challenging condition.;0.0;1708.0;143.0;0.21;0.031;0.134;0.755;-0.251;-0.24;-0.266
721;gemini-pro;symptoms;What are the symptoms of Book syndrome ?;"What are the signs and symptoms of Book syndrome? To our knowledge, Book syndrome has only been reported in one, large Swedish family (25 cases in 4 generations) and in one other isolated case. The signs and symptoms reported in the Swedish family included premolar aplasia (when the premolars fail to develop); excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis); and early whitening of the hair. Early whitening of the hair was the most constant symptom, being found in every affected family member. The age of onset of this symptom ranged from age 6 to age 23. In some cases, there was whitening of hair on other parts of the body such as the armipits, genital hair, and eyebrows. Two-thirds of the affected people had an abnormality of the sweat glands. In the isolated case, additional features that were reported include a narrow palate (roof of the mouth); hypoplastic (underdeveloped) nails; eyebrow anomalies; a unilateral simian crease; and poorly formed dermatoglyphics (skin patterns on the hands and feet). The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Book syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.";Book syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by distinctive facial features, intellectual disability, short stature, and skeletal abnormalities. Infants with Book syndrome typically have a flattened face, widely spaced eyes, a broad nasal bridge, a small mouth, and low-set ears. They may also have microcephaly (small head size), hypotonia (low muscle tone), and feeding difficulties. As children with Book syndrome grow older, they may develop scoliosis (curvature of the spine), joint laxity, and delayed bone age. They may also have difficulty with speech and language, and they may need special education services.;0.001;363.0;88.0;0.125;0.01;0.07;0.588;-0.218;-0.377;-0.051

723;gemini-pro;causes;What causes Diarrhea ?;"Acute diarrhea is usually caused by a bacterial, viral, or parasitic infection. Chronic diarrhea is usually related to a functional disorder such as irritable bowel syndrome or an intestinal disease such as Crohns disease.
                
The most common causes of diarrhea include the following:
                
- Bacterial infections. Several types of bacteria consumed through contaminated food or water can cause diarrhea. Common culprits include Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, and Escherichia coli (E. coli).  - Viral infections. Many viruses cause diarrhea, including rotavirus, norovirus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and viral hepatitis. Infection with the rotavirus is the most common cause of acute diarrhea in children. Rotavirus diarrhea usually resolves in 3 to 7 days but can cause problems digesting lactose for up to a month or longer.  - Parasites. Parasites can enter the body through food or water and settle in the digestive system. Parasites that cause diarrhea include Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, and Cryptosporidium.  - Functional bowel disorders. Diarrhea can be a symptom of irritable bowel syndrome.  - Intestinal diseases. Inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohns disease, and celiac disease often lead to diarrhea.  - Food intolerances and sensitivities. Some people have difficulty digesting certain ingredients, such as lactose, the sugar found in milk and milk products. Some people may have diarrhea if they eat certain types of sugar substitutes in excessive quantities.  - Reaction to medicines. Antibiotics, cancer drugs, and antacids containing magnesium can all cause diarrhea.
                
Some people develop diarrhea after stomach surgery, which may cause food to move through the digestive system more quickly.
                
People who visit certain foreign countries are at risk for travelers diarrhea, which is caused by eating food or drinking water contaminated with bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Travelers diarrhea can be a problem for people traveling to developing countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Visitors to Canada, most European countries, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand do not face much risk for travelers diarrhea.
                
In many cases, the cause of diarrhea cannot be found. As long as diarrhea goes away on its own within 1 to 2 days, finding the cause is not usually necessary.";"Diarrhea is a common digestive problem characterized by loose, watery stools that occur more frequently than usual. It can be caused by various factors, including bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; food poisoning; certain medications; lactose intolerance; irritable bowel syndrome; inflammatory bowel disease; and certain medical conditions such as celiac disease or Crohn's disease. In some cases, diarrhea can also be a sign of more serious underlying conditions, such as thyroid problems or cancer. If diarrhea persists for more than a few days, it is essential to consult a healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause and receive appropriate treatment.";0.007;327.0;94.0;0.333;0.078;0.22;0.726;-0.068;-0.221;0.09
724;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to hereditary sensory neuropathy type IA ?;Mutations in the SPTLC1 gene cause hereditary sensory neuropathy type IA. The SPTLC1 gene provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of an enzyme called serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT). The SPT enzyme is involved in making certain fats called sphingolipids. Sphingolipids are important components of cell membranes and play a role in many cell functions.  SPTLC1 gene mutations reduce the amount of functional SPTLC1 subunit that is produced, which results in an SPT enzyme with altered activity. This altered enzyme makes molecules called deoxysphingoid bases, which it does not normally produce. Because of this new function, the SPT enzyme's production of sphingolipid is reduced. Overall, there does not seem to be a decrease in sphingolipid production because the body is able to compensate for the SPT enzyme's reduced production. When accumulated, deoxysphingoid bases are toxic to neurons. The gradual destruction of nerve cells caused by the buildup of these toxic molecules results in loss of sensation and muscle weakness in people with hereditary sensory neuropathy type IA. Although the SPT enzyme does not produce a normal amount of sphingolipids, the body is able to compensate, and there does not seem to be an overall reduction of these fats in the body.;Hereditary sensory neuropathy type IA (HSN1A) is an inherited disorder of the peripheral nervous system that affects the sensory nerves. It is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the protein septin 9 (SEPT9). SEPT9 is involved in the formation of the axonal cytoskeleton, which is essential for the proper function of neurons. Mutations in SEPT9 can lead to the degeneration of sensory neurons, resulting in symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and pain in the hands and feet. Additionally, HSN1A can cause problems with coordination and balance, as well as difficulty with fine motor skills.;0.027;182.0;85.0;0.295;0.067;0.167;0.549;-0.021;-0.152;0.114

The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the labs that offer genetic testing for these conditions. On the GTR Web site, search for a disorder to find out about the genetic tests that are available. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Therefore, patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional.;To diagnose anaplastic astrocytoma, healthcare providers typically begin by obtaining a detailed medical history and conducting a thorough neurological examination. This may include testing reflexes, muscle strength, balance, and coordination. Additionally, imaging studies such as MRI or CT scans are performed to visualize the tumor's location, size, and extent. To confirm the diagnosis, a biopsy or surgical removal of a small tissue sample from the tumor is often necessary. The tissue sample is then examined under a microscope by a pathologist to determine the tumor's grade, type, and molecular characteristics, which can aid in determining the appropriate treatment plan.;0.006;117.0;87.0;0.174;0.0;0.094;0.592;-0.113;-0.122;-0.108

Therapies focus on managing symptoms and improving the patient's quality of life. Since it is a genetic condition, there is no cure known to reverse the underlying cause. Management strategies include: 1) Dermatological care: Moisturizers, emollients, or topical steroids may help alleviate dry skin and reduce inflammation. 2) Sun protection: Individuals with NFJS should minimize sun exposure and use protective measures such as sunscreen, hats, and clothing to prevent further skin damage. 3) Ophthalmological care: Regular eye examinations are recommended to monitor and address any ocular complications, such as corneal scarring or cataracts. 4) Orthopedic care: Physical therapy or orthotics may be beneficial in managing joint pain or deformities. 5) Psychological support: Counseling or support groups can provide emotional support and guidance for individuals and families coping with the physical and psychosocial aspects of NFJS.;0.016;62.0;149.0;0.198;0.03;0.086;0.623;-0.081;-0.052;-0.113
731;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Heart Failure ?;In heart failure, the heart cannot pump enough blood through the body. Heart failure develops over time as the pumping action of the heart gets weaker. Heart failure does not mean that the heart has stopped working or is about to stop working. When the heart is weakened by heart failure, blood and fluid can back up into the lungs and fluid builds up in the feet, ankles, and legs. People with heart failure often experience tiredness and shortness of breath.;Heart failure, also known as congestive heart failure (CHF), is a condition in which the heart is unable to pump blood adequately to meet the body's demands. This can be caused by various factors, including damage to the heart muscle, narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to the heart, and high blood pressure. As a result, blood can back up in the lungs, causing shortness of breath, and in the body's tissues, leading to swelling and fluid retention. Heart failure can range from mild to severe, and it can be managed with medications, lifestyle changes, and in some cases, surgery or other interventions.;0.046;73.0;95.0;0.362;0.103;0.207;0.626;0.165;0.255;0.076
732;gemini-pro;treatment;What are the treatments for Epilepsy ?;Once epilepsy is diagnosed, it is important to begin treatment as soon as possible. For about 70 percent of those diagnosed with epilepsy, seizures can be controlled with modern medicines and surgical techniques. Some drugs are more effective for specific types of seizures. An individual with seizures, particularly those that are not easily controlled, may want to see a neurologist specifically trained to treat epilepsy. In some children, special diets may help to control seizures when medications are either not effective or cause serious side effects.;Epilepsy treatments vary depending on the type of epilepsy, seizure frequency, and individual response. Common treatments include anti-seizure medications, which help control seizures by reducing abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Surgery may be an option for people with drug-resistant epilepsy, involving removing the part of the brain causing seizures. Other treatments include vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), a device placed under the skin that sends electrical signals to the brain, and ketogenic diet, a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that can help reduce seizures in some people. Additionally, lifestyle modifications such as adequate sleep, stress management, and avoiding triggers that may provoke seizures are often recommended.;0.017;84.0;95.0;0.281;0.023;0.178;0.809;-0.001;0.031;-0.035
733;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Arrhythmia ?;An arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat. It means that your heart beats too quickly, too slowly, or with an irregular pattern. When the heart beats faster than normal, it is called tachycardia. When the heart beats too slowly, it is called bradycardia. The most common type of arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation, which causes an irregular and fast heart beat.    Many factors can affect your heart's rhythm, such as having had a heart attack, smoking, congenital heart defects, and stress. Some substances or medicines may also cause arrhythmias.     Symptoms of arrhythmias include       - Fast or slow heart beat    - Skipping beats    - Lightheadedness or dizziness    - Chest pain    - Shortness of breath     - Sweating        Your doctor can run tests to find out if you have an arrhythmia. Treatment to restore a normal heart rhythm may include medicines, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or pacemaker, or sometimes surgery.     NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute;Arrhythmia is a general term for any abnormality in the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. It can be caused by a variety of underlying conditions, including heart disease, thyroid problems, or electrolyte imbalances. Arrhythmias can range from mild and asymptomatic to severe and life-threatening. Symptoms can include palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or dizziness. Treatment for arrhythmia depends on the underlying cause and the severity of the condition, and may involve lifestyle changes, medications, or surgical procedures.;0.05;141.0;73.0;0.32;0.108;0.253;0.852;0.122;0.081;0.159

The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Tetralogy of Fallot. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal nasal morphology 90% Brachydactyly syndrome 90% Broad forehead 90% Clinodactyly of the 5th finger 90% Intrauterine growth retardation 90% Abnormality of periauricular region 50% Cryptorchidism 50% Dolichocephaly 50% Proptosis 50% Tetralogy of Fallot 50% Thin vermilion border 50% Underdeveloped supraorbital ridges 50% Autosomal dominant inheritance - Preauricular pit - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.;"Tetralogy of Fallot, a congenital heart defect, is characterized by four distinct anomalies: a large ventricular septal defect, overriding aorta, pulmonary stenosis, and right ventricular hypertrophy. Symptoms may vary depending on the severity of the condition, but commonly include shortness of breath, cyanosis (a bluish tint to the skin, lips, and nails), fatigue, and poor growth. Infants with Tetralogy of Fallot may experience ""spells"" or episodes of sudden increased cyanosis and difficulty breathing, particularly during crying, feeding, or exertion. These spells are often triggered by a drop in oxygen levels and can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.";0.007;244.0;91.0;0.19;0.013;0.124;0.574;-0.248;-0.358;-0.137
735;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to Leigh syndrome ?;Leigh syndrome can be caused by mutations in one of over 30 different genes. In humans, most genes are found in DNA in the cell's nucleus, called nuclear DNA. However, some genes are found in DNA in specialized structures in the cell called mitochondria. This type of DNA is known as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). While most people with Leigh syndrome have a mutation in nuclear DNA, about 20 to 25 percent have a mutation in mtDNA.  Most genes associated with Leigh syndrome are involved in the process of energy production in mitochondria. Mitochondria use oxygen to convert the energy from food into a form cells can use. Five protein complexes, made up of several proteins each, are involved in this process, called oxidative phosphorylation. The complexes are named complex I, complex II, complex III, complex IV, and complex V. During oxidative phosphorylation, the protein complexes drive the production of ATP, the cell's main energy source, through a step-by-step transfer of negatively charged particles called electrons. Many of the gene mutations associated with Leigh syndrome affect proteins in complexes I, II, IV, or V or disrupt the assembly of these complexes. These mutations reduce or eliminate the activity of one or more of these complexes, which can lead to Leigh syndrome.  Disruption of complex IV, also called cytochrome c oxidase or COX, is the most common cause of Leigh syndrome. The most frequently mutated gene in COX-deficient Leigh syndrome is called SURF1. This gene, which is found in nuclear DNA, provides instructions for making a protein that helps assemble the COX protein complex (complex IV). The COX protein complex, which is involved in the last step of electron transfer in oxidative phosphorylation, provides the energy that will be used in the next step of the process to generate ATP. Mutations in the SURF1 gene typically lead to an abnormally short SURF1 protein that is broken down in cells, resulting in the absence of functional SURF1 protein. The loss of this protein reduces the formation of normal COX complexes, which impairs mitochondrial energy production.  Other nuclear DNA mutations associated with Leigh syndrome decrease the activity of other oxidative phosphorylation protein complexes or affect additional steps related to energy production. For example, Leigh syndrome can be caused by mutations in genes that form the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. These mutations lead to a shortage of pyruvate dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in mitochondrial energy production.  The most common mtDNA mutation in Leigh syndrome affects the MT-ATP6 gene, which provides instructions for making a piece of complex V, also known as the ATP synthase protein complex. Using the energy provided by the other protein complexes, the ATP synthase complex generates ATP. MT-ATP6 gene mutations, found in 10 to 20 percent of people with Leigh syndrome, block the generation of ATP. Other mtDNA mutations associated with Leigh syndrome decrease the activity of other oxidative phosphorylation protein complexes or lead to reduced mitochondrial protein synthesis, all of which impair mitochondrial energy production.  Although the exact mechanism is unclear, researchers believe that impaired oxidative phosphorylation can lead to cell death because of decreased energy available in the cell. Certain tissues that require large amounts of energy, such as the brain, muscles, and heart, seem especially sensitive to decreases in cellular energy. Cell death in the brain likely causes the characteristic lesions seen in Leigh syndrome, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of the condition. Cell death in other sensitive tissues may also contribute to the features of Leigh syndrome.;Leigh syndrome is a severe neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, leading to impaired energy production and cellular dysfunction. These mutations can occur in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, affecting genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial translation, assembly, and maintenance. Common genetic changes associated with Leigh syndrome include mutations in genes encoding subunits of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I, IV, and V, as well as genes involved in mitochondrial DNA replication, transcription, and translation. Additionally, mutations in genes encoding components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which is responsible for converting pyruvate to acetyl-CoA for energy production, have also been linked to Leigh syndrome.;0.003;531.0;105.0;0.3;0.091;0.202;0.846;0.013;-0.115;0.145
736;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Gamma aminobutyric acid transaminase deficiency ?;GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is an important molecule which slows down the activity of cells in the brain.[1] GABA is broken down in the body by a substance known as 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase, also known as GABA-transaminase or GABA-T.[1] Mutations in the ABAT gene can cause less GABA-T to be made, a condition known as GABA-T deficiency.[1] The symptoms for an individual with GABA-T deficiency can include: psychomotor retardation (a slowing down of thought and activity), low muscle tone, hyperactive responses, lethargy, seizures, and EEG abnormalities.[1] GABA-T deficiency is very rare, with fewer than 5 cases reported in the literature.[2] It is thought to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.[3][4];Gamma aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T) deficiency is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme GABA-T, which is responsible for the breakdown of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. As a result of this deficiency, GABA levels accumulate in the brain, leading to a hyperexcitable state and a variety of neurological symptoms, including seizures, hypotonia, intellectual disability, and developmental delay. The severity of symptoms can vary widely among affected individuals, ranging from mild to severe. Treatment typically involves the use of anticonvulsant medications to control seizures and supportive care to address other symptoms.;0.028;97.0;90.0;0.255;0.044;0.17;0.862;0.028;0.016;0.038
737;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to citrullinemia ?;Mutations in the ASS1 and SLC25A13 genes cause citrullinemia.  Citrullinemia belongs to a class of genetic diseases called urea cycle disorders. The urea cycle is a sequence of chemical reactions that takes place in liver cells. These reactions process excess nitrogen that is generated when protein is used by the body. The excess nitrogen is used to make a compound called urea, which is excreted in urine.  Mutations in the ASS1 gene cause type I citrullinemia. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme, argininosuccinate synthase 1, that is responsible for one step of the urea cycle. Mutations in the ASS1 gene reduce the activity of the enzyme, which disrupts the urea cycle and prevents the body from processing nitrogen effectively. Excess nitrogen (in the form of ammonia) and other byproducts of the urea cycle accumulate in the bloodstream. Ammonia is particularly toxic to the nervous system, which helps explain the neurologic symptoms (such as lethargy, seizures, and ataxia) that are often seen in type I citrullinemia.  Mutations in the SLC25A13 gene are responsible for adult-onset type II citrullinemia and NICCD. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called citrin. Within cells, citrin helps transport molecules used in the production and breakdown of simple sugars, the production of proteins, and the urea cycle. Molecules transported by citrin are also involved in making nucleotides, which are the building blocks of DNA and its chemical cousin, RNA. Mutations in the SLC25A13 gene typically prevent cells from making any functional citrin, which inhibits the urea cycle and disrupts the production of proteins and nucleotides. The resulting buildup of ammonia and other toxic substances leads to the signs and symptoms of adult-onset type II citrullinemia. A lack of citrin also leads to the features of NICCD, although ammonia does not build up in the bloodstream of infants with this condition.;In citrullinemia, the genetic alterations affect the urea cycle, a crucial metabolic pathway responsible for the breakdown and removal of nitrogenous waste products from the body, particularly ammonia. These genetic defects occur in genes encoding enzymes involved in the urea cycle, leading to the accumulation of citrulline and other intermediates. The specific genetic changes can vary, including mutations or deletions in the genes encoding argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS), argininosuccinate lyase (ASL), ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC), or carbamyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS I). These genetic variations disrupt the normal function of the urea cycle enzymes, resulting in an impaired ability to convert citrulline to arginine and ultimately to urea, leading to the characteristic features and clinical manifestations of citrullinemia.;0.007;273.0;103.0;0.242;0.031;0.141;0.817;-0.01;-0.101;0.081
738;gemini-pro;outlook;What is the outlook for Laryngeal Cancer ?;Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. Prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on the following:         - The stage of the disease.    - The location and size of the tumor.    - The grade of the tumor.    - The patient's age, gender, and general health, including whether the patient is anemic.         Treatment options depend on the following:         - The stage of the disease.    - The location and size of the tumor.    - Keeping the patient's ability to talk, eat, and breathe as normal as possible.    - Whether the cancer has come back (recurred).        Smoking tobacco and drinking alcohol decrease the effectiveness of treatment for laryngeal cancer. Patients with laryngeal cancer who continue to smoke and drink are less likely to be cured and more likely to develop a second tumor. After treatment for laryngeal cancer, frequent and careful follow-up is important.;The outlook for laryngeal cancer depends on various factors, including the stage of the cancer, the patient's age and overall health, and the type of treatment received. In general, the earlier the cancer is detected and treated, the better the prognosis. With early-stage cancer, the five-year survival rate is approximately 90%. However, if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, the survival rate decreases significantly. Treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or a combination of these approaches. The goal of treatment is to remove the cancer, preserve laryngeal function, and prevent its recurrence. Regular follow-up care is crucial to monitor for any signs of recurrence and manage any long-term effects of treatment.;0.032;116.0;104.0;0.306;0.092;0.194;0.755;0.089;0.102;0.074

Men are more likely than women to have sleep apnea. Although the condition can occur at any age, the risk increases as you get older. A family history of sleep apnea also increases your risk for the condition.
                
People who have small airways in their noses, throats, or mouths are more likely to have sleep apnea. Small airways might be due to the shape of these structures or allergies or other conditions that cause congestion.
                
Small children might have enlarged tonsil tissues in their throats. Enlarged tonsil tissues raise a childs risk for sleep apnea. Overweight children also might be at increased risk for sleep apnea.
                
About half of the people who have sleep apnea also have high blood pressure. Sleep apnea also is linked to smoking, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and risk factors for stroke and heart failure.
                
Race and ethnicity might play a role in the risk of developing sleep apnea. However, more research is needed.";Individuals at risk for sleep apnea include those who are overweight or obese, have a large neck circumference, have a family history of sleep apnea, or are older than 40 years of age. Additionally, people with certain medical conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes are also at an increased risk.

743;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is Dextrocardia with situs inversus inherited ?;Is dextrocardia with situs inversus inherited? In most cases of dextrocardia with situs inversus, a specific genetic cause has not been identified and inheritance patterns have not been confirmed. However, approximately 25% of affected people have primary ciliary dyskinesia, which is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier.;Dextrocardia with situs inversus is usually a sporadic finding, meaning it occurs in individuals with no family history of the condition. However, in rare instances, it may be inherited in an autosomal recessive or dominant manner. This means that the affected individual inherits two copies of the defective gene, one from each parent, in the case of autosomal recessive inheritance, or only one copy of the defective gene, from either parent, in the case of autosomal dominant inheritance.;0.059;136.0;70.0;0.432;0.141;0.304;0.883;0.181;0.071;0.294
744;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is Juvenile Huntington disease inherited ?;How is Juvenile Huntington disease (HD) inherited? Juvenile HD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, which means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. An affected person usually inherits the altered gene from one affected parent. As the altered HTT gene is passed from one generation to the next, the size of the CAG trinucleotide repeat often increases in size. A larger number of repeats is usually associated with an earlier onset of signs and symptoms (anticipation). A larger number of repeats is usually associated with an earlier onset of signs and symptoms. Most often, children with juvenile HD inherit the expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat from their fathers, although on occasion they inherit it from their mothers.;Yes, Juvenile Huntington disease (JHD) is an inherited disorder. It is an autosomal dominant condition, meaning that only one copy of the altered gene is needed to cause the disease. The altered gene responsible for JHD is located on chromosome 4 and contains a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HTT gene. This expansion results in an abnormal form of the huntingtin protein, which leads to the development of JHD. Typically, people inherit one copy of the altered gene from an affected parent, while the other copy is normal. However, in some cases, the disease can be inherited from both parents, which can lead to a more severe form of the disorder.;0.086;113.0;96.0;0.446;0.166;0.323;0.816;0.209;0.174;0.241

Results of a very small clinical trial of children with infantile Krabbe disease found that children who received umbilical cord blood stem cells from unrelated donors prior to symptom onset developed with little neurological impairment. Bone marrow transplantation may help some people. Generally, treatment for the disorder is symptomatic and supportive. Physical therapy may help maintain or increase muscle tone and circulation.;Treatment options for Krabbe Disease are limited and vary depending on the age of onset and severity of symptoms. For infants with early-onset, severe forms of the disease, hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the only potentially curative treatment. HSCT involves replacing the patient's diseased bone marrow with healthy stem cells from a donor. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with imiglucerase is another treatment option, but it is only effective if started early in the course of the disease and may not prevent all neurological damage. Palliative care, which focuses on managing symptoms and improving the patient's quality of life, is an important part of treatment for all individuals with Krabbe Disease. This may include physical therapy, occupational therapy, and medications to manage seizures, spasticity, and other symptoms.;0.033;67.0;118.0;0.273;0.079;0.187;0.814;0.084;0.164;0.003
746;gemini-pro;symptoms;What are the symptoms of Urinary Tract Infections in Children ?;"Symptoms of a UTI range from slight burning with urination or unusual-smelling urine to severe pain and high fever. A child with a UTI may also have no symptoms. A UTI causes irritation of the lining of the bladder, urethra, ureters, and kidneys, just as the inside of the nose or the throat becomes irritated with a cold. In infants or children who are only a few years old, the signs of a UTI may not be clear because children that young cannot express exactly how they feel. Children may have a high fever, be irritable, or not eat.
                
On the other hand, children may have only a low-grade fever; experience nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; or just not seem healthy. Children who have a high fever and appear sick for more than a day without signs of a runny nose or other obvious cause for discomfort should be checked for a UTI.
                
Older children with UTIs may complain of pain in the middle and lower abdomen. They may urinate often. Crying or complaining that it hurts to urinate and producing only a few drops of urine at a time are other signs of a UTI. Children may leak urine into clothing or bedsheets. The urine may look cloudy or bloody. If a kidney is infected, children may complain of pain in the back or side below the ribs.

Achieving major weight loss
                
Treating underlying and related conditions
                
Breathing Support
                
Positive Airway Pressure
                
Treatment for OHS often involves a machine that provides positive airway pressure (PAP) while you sleep.
                
PAP therapy uses mild air pressure to keep your airways open. This treatment can help your body better maintain the carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in your blood. PAP therapy also can help relieve daytime sleepiness.
                
Your doctor might recommend CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) or BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure). CPAP provides continuous mild air pressure to keep your airways open. BiPAP works almost the same, but it changes the air pressure while you breathe in and out.
                
The machines have three main parts:
                
A mask or other device that fits over your nose or your nose and mouth. Straps keep the mask in place while you're wearing it.
                
A tube that connects the mask to the machine's motor.
                
A motor that blows air into the tube.
                
Some machines have other features, such as heated humidifiers. The machines are small, lightweight, and fairly quiet. The noise they make is soft and rhythmic.
                
Some people who have OHS receive extra oxygen as part of their PAP treatment. However, oxygen therapy alone isn't recommended as a treatment for OHS.
                
PAP therapy also is used to treat obstructive sleep apnea. Many people who have OHS also have this common condition.
                
If your doctor prescribes PAP therapy, you'll work with someone from a home equipment provider to select a CPAP or BiPAP machine. The home equipment provider will help you pick a machine based on your prescription and the features that meet your needs.
                
Ventilator Support
                
If you have severe OHS that requires treatment in a hospital, you might be put on a ventilator. A ventilator is a machine that supports breathing. This machine:
                
Gets oxygen into your lungs
                
Removes carbon dioxide from your body
                
Helps you breathe easier
                
A ventilator blows air, or air with extra oxygen, into the airways through a breathing tube. One end of the tube is inserted into your windpipe, and the other end is hooked to the ventilator.
                
Usually, the breathing tube is put into your nose or mouth and then moved down into your throat. A tube placed like this is called an endotracheal (en-do-TRA-ke-al) tube. Endotracheal tubes are used only in a hospital setting.
                
Sometimes the breathing tube is placed through a surgically made hole called a tracheostomy (TRA-ke-OS-toe-me). The hole goes through the front of your neck and into your windpipe.
                
The procedure to make a tracheostomy usually is done in an operating room. You'll be given medicine so you won't feel any pain. The tracheostomy allows you to be on a ventilator in the hospital, in a long-term care facility, or at home.
                
Talk with your doctor about how long you'll need ventilator support and whether you can receive treatment at home.
                
For more information about ventilator support, go to the Health Topics Ventilator/Ventilator Support article.
                
Weight Loss
                
Your doctor will likely recommend weight loss as part of your treatment plan. Successful weight loss often involves setting goals and making lifestyle changes. For example, eating fewer calories and being physically active can help you lose weight.
                
Medicines and weight-loss surgery might be an option if lifestyle changes aren't enough. Your doctor will advise you on the best weight-loss treatment for you.
                
For more information about weight loss, go to the treatment section of the Health Topics Overweight and Obesity article.
                
Medicines
                
Your doctor may prescribe medicines to treat OHS (although this treatment is less common than others).
                
Your doctor also may advise you to avoid certain substances and medicines that can worsen OHS. Examples include alcohol, sedatives, and narcotics. They can interfere with how well your body is able to maintain normal carbon dioxide and oxygen levels.
                
If you're having surgery, make sure you tell your surgeon and health care team that you have OHS. Some medicines routinely used for surgery can worsen your condition.";Treatment for obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) typically involves a combination of lifestyle changes, breathing support, and medical interventions. Lifestyle changes may include weight loss through diet and exercise, smoking cessation, and getting regular check-ups. Breathing support may involve supplemental oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation (using a mask or nasal prongs to deliver pressurized air), or invasive ventilation (using a tracheostomy tube to deliver air directly to the lungs). Medical interventions may include medications to improve breathing, such as bronchodilators, diuretics, and steroids. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to reduce the size of the stomach or bypass part of the intestine in order to aid in weight loss.;0.0;635.0;101.0;0.203;0.047;0.137;0.777;-0.141;-0.291;0.014
748;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is maternally inherited diabetes and deafness inherited ?;MIDD is inherited in a mitochondrial pattern, which is also known as maternal inheritance. This pattern of inheritance applies to genes contained in mtDNA. Because egg cells, but not sperm cells, contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, children can only inherit disorders resulting from mtDNA mutations from their mother. These disorders can appear in every generation of a family and can affect both males and females, but fathers do not pass traits associated with changes in mtDNA to their children.  Most of the body's cells contain thousands of mitochondria, each with one or more copies of mtDNA. These cells can have a mix of mitochondria containing mutated and unmutated DNA (heteroplasmy). The severity of MIDD is thought to be associated with the percentage of mitochondria with the mtDNA mutation.;Maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondrial DNA is passed down from mother to child, which is why MIDD is maternally inherited. The most common symptom of MIDD is diabetes, which typically develops in childhood or adolescence. Other symptoms can include hearing loss, muscle weakness, and vision problems. The severity of MIDD can vary widely, even among members of the same family. There is no cure for MIDD, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms.;0.028;121.0;82.0;0.279;0.052;0.191;0.569;0.036;-0.021;0.091
749;gemini-pro;causes;What causes Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome ?;"Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is a breathing disorder that affects some obese people. Why these people develop OHS isn't fully known. Researchers think that several factors may work together to cause OHS. These factors include:
                
A respiratory (RES-pih-rah-tor-e) system that has to work harder than normal and perhaps differently because of excess body weight. (The respiratory system is a group of organs and tissues, including the lungs, that helps you breathe.)
                
A slow response by the body to fix the problem of too much carbon dioxide and too little oxygen in the blood.
                
The presence of sleep apnea, usually obstructive sleep apnea.";Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (OHS) is a disorder characterized by excessive weight gain and inadequate breathing, leading to abnormally low blood oxygen levels and high carbon dioxide levels. The primary cause of OHS is severe obesity, particularly when body mass index (BMI) exceeds 40 kg/m^2. This excessive fat accumulation can lead to mechanical dysfunction of the respiratory system, decreased lung volumes, and impaired respiratory muscle function. Additionally, hormonal imbalances and inflammatory processes associated with obesity contribute to the development of OHS. These factors collectively result in a diminished ability to breathe effectively, leading to the characteristic symptoms and complications of the syndrome.;0.074;92.0;94.0;0.338;0.089;0.183;0.929;0.083;0.068;0.096
750;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to Unverricht-Lundborg disease ?;Mutations in the CSTB gene cause Unverricht-Lundborg disease. The CSTB gene provides instructions for making a protein called cystatin B. This protein reduces the activity of enzymes called cathepsins. Cathepsins help break down certain proteins in the lysosomes (compartments in the cell that digest and recycle materials). While the specific function of cystatin B is unclear, it may help protect the cells' proteins from cathepsins that leak out of the lysosomes.  In almost all affected individuals, Unverricht-Lundborg disease is caused by an increase in size of the CSTB gene. One region of the CSTB gene has a particular repeating sequence of 12 DNA building blocks (nucleotides). This sequence is normally repeated two or three times within the gene and is called a dodecamer repeat. Most people with this disorder have more than 30 repeats of the dodecamer sequence in both copies of the CSTB gene. A small number of people with Unverricht-Lundborg disease carry other mutations.  The increased number of dodecamer repeats in the CSTB gene seems to interfere with the production of the cystatin B protein. Levels of cystatin B in affected individuals are only 5 to 10 percent of normal, and cathepsin levels are significantly increased. These changes are believed to cause the signs and symptoms of Unverricht-Lundborg disease, but it is unclear how a reduction in the amount of cystatin B leads to the features of this disorder.;Unverricht-Lundborg disease is a rare, inherited disorder of the nervous system characterized by progressive ataxia, epilepsy, and cognitive decline. It is caused by mutations in the CSTB gene, which encodes the protein cystatin B. Cystatin B is a protease inhibitor that plays a role in regulating the activity of cathepsins, a family of proteases involved in various cellular processes. Mutations in the CSTB gene lead to either a complete loss or reduction in the activity of cystatin B, resulting in an imbalance in the activity of cathepsins. This imbalance is thought to contribute to the neurodegeneration and clinical features of Unverricht-Lundborg disease.;0.029;205.0;88.0;0.281;0.117;0.175;0.753;0.191;0.12;0.26

People with WAGR syndrome have a 45 to 60 percent chance of developing Wilms tumor, a rare form of kidney cancer. This type of cancer is most often diagnosed in children but is sometimes seen in adults.  Most people with WAGR syndrome have aniridia, an absence of the colored part of the eye (the iris). This can cause reduction in the sharpness of vision (visual acuity) and increased sensitivity to light (photophobia). Aniridia is typically the first noticeable sign of WAGR syndrome. Other eye problems may also develop, such as clouding of the lens of the eyes (cataracts), increased pressure in the eyes (glaucoma), and involuntary eye movements (nystagmus).  Abnormalities of the genitalia and urinary tract (genitourinary anomalies) are seen more frequently in males with WAGR syndrome than in affected females. The most common genitourinary anomaly in affected males is undescended testes (cryptorchidism). Females may not have functional ovaries and instead have undeveloped clumps of tissue called streak gonads. Females may also have a heart-shaped (bicornate) uterus, which makes it difficult to carry a pregnancy to term.  Another common feature of WAGR syndrome is intellectual disability. Affected individuals often have difficulty processing, learning, and properly responding to information. Some individuals with WAGR syndrome also have psychiatric or behavioral problems including depression, anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or a developmental disorder called autism that affects communication and social interaction.  Other signs and symptoms of WAGR syndrome can include childhood-onset obesity, inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), and kidney failure. When WAGR syndrome includes childhood-onset obesity, it is often referred to as WAGRO syndrome.;WAGR syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused by the deletion of a specific region on chromosome 11. It is characterized by a combination of features including Wilms' tumor (a type of kidney cancer), aniridia (absence of the iris in the eye), genitourinary abnormalities, and intellectual disability. WAGR syndrome affects both males and females equally, and its severity can vary widely among individuals. Treatment for WAGR syndrome typically involves managing the associated medical conditions, such as Wilms' tumor, aniridia, and genitourinary abnormalities.

The pituitary is the ""master control gland"" - it makes hormones that affect growth and the functions of other glands in the body.     Pituitary tumors are common, but often they don't cause health problems. Most people with pituitary tumors never even know they have them. The most common type of pituitary tumor produces hormones and disrupts the balance of hormones in your body. This can cause endocrine diseases such as Cushing's syndrome and hyperthyroidism.    Symptoms of pituitary tumors include       - Headaches     - Vision problems    - Nausea and vomiting    - Problems caused by the production of too many hormones       Pituitary tumors are usually curable. Treatment is often surgery to remove the tumor. Other options include medicines, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.";Pituitary tumors, also known as hypophyseal tumors, are benign or cancerous growths that arise from the pituitary gland, a small, pea-sized structure located at the base of the brain. These tumors can disrupt the normal production of hormones that control various bodily functions, leading to a range of symptoms. The most common type of pituitary tumor is a benign adenoma, which can cause hormonal imbalances, vision problems, and headaches. Other, less common types of pituitary tumors, such as craniopharyngiomas and meningiomas, can cause similar symptoms and require specialized treatment.

768;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to Kuskokwim syndrome ?;Kuskokwim syndrome is caused by mutations in the FKBP10 gene, which provides instructions for making the FKBP10 protein (formerly known as FKBP65). This protein is important for the correct processing of complex molecules called collagens, which provide structure and strength to connective tissues that support the body's bones, joints, and organs. Collagen molecules are cross-linked to one another to form long, thin fibrils, which are found in the spaces around cells (the extracellular matrix). The formation of cross-links results in very strong collagen fibrils. The FKBP10 protein attaches to collagens and plays a role in their cross-linking.  A mutation in the FKBP10 gene alters the FKBP10 protein, making it unstable and easily broken down. As a result, people with Kuskokwim syndrome have only about 5 percent of the normal amount of FKBP10 protein. This reduction in protein levels impairs collagen cross-linking and leads to a disorganized network of collagen molecules. It is unclear how these changes in the collagen matrix are involved in the development of joint contractures and other abnormalities in people with Kuskokwim syndrome.;Kuskokwim syndrome is characterized by various dysmorphic features, heart defects, and developmental delay. The genetic basis of Kuskokwim syndrome is attributed to mutations in the ANKRD11 gene, located on chromosome 16q24.3. These mutations can be either frameshift or missense variants, leading to the production of a nonfunctional or truncated ANKRD11 protein. The ANKRD11 gene encodes a protein involved in regulating gene expression and maintaining the integrity of nuclear structures. Disruption of ANKRD11 function due to mutations impairs these processes, resulting in the clinical manifestations observed in Kuskokwim syndrome.;0.015;159.0;80.0;0.181;0.036;0.155;0.58;0.092;0.009;0.174

However, many people think they pass gas too often and that they have too much gas. Having too much gas is rare.  - Gas in the digestive tract is usually caused by swallowing air and by the breakdown of certain foods in the large intestine by bacteria.  - Most foods that contain carbohydrates can cause gas. In contrast, fats and proteins cause little gas.  - Foods that produce gas in one person may not cause gas for someone else.  - The most common symptoms of gas are burping, passing gas, bloating, and abdominal pain or discomfort.  - Gas can be treated by reducing swallowed air, making dietary changes, or taking over-the-counter or prescription medications.;"If you're experiencing excessive gas in your digestive tract, there are several strategies you can try to alleviate the discomfort:

1. **Dietary Modifications:**
   - Reduce the intake of foods known to cause gas, such as beans, lentils, cabbage, and cruciferous vegetables.
   - Avoid carbonated drinks and sugary foods, as they can release gas during digestion.
   - Eat smaller meals more frequently throughout the day to aid digestion and reduce bloating.

2. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - Incorporate regular physical activity into your routine, as exercise can help move gas through the digestive tract.
   - Avoid chewing gum or sucking on hard candies, as these actions can introduce air into your digestive system.
   - Try relaxation techniques like yoga or deep breathing to reduce stress, which can contribute to gas production.

3. **Over-the-Counter Remedies:**
   - Consider using over-the-counter gas relievers like simethicone or activated charcoal, which can help break down and absorb gas bubbles.
   - Peppermint or ginger supplements may also help alleviate gas and bloating.

Hyperthyroidism is sometimes called thyrotoxicosis, the technical term for too much thyroid hormone in the blood. Thyroid hormones circulate throughout the body in the bloodstream and act on virtually every tissue and cell in the body. Hyperthyroidism causes many of the bodys functions to speed up. About 1 percent of the U.S. population has hyperthyroidism.1;Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including weight loss, increased heart rate, nervousness, anxiety, heat intolerance, and difficulty sleeping. It can also cause goiter, which is an enlargement of the thyroid gland. Hyperthyroidism is most commonly caused by Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system attacks the thyroid gland. Other causes include thyroid nodules, inflammation of the thyroid gland, and certain medications. Treatment for hyperthyroidism typically involves medication to reduce thyroid hormone production or radioactive iodine therapy to destroy thyroid tissue.;0.048;63.0;92.0;0.271;0.069;0.186;0.723;0.152;0.167;0.134

773;gemini-pro;exams and tests;How to diagnose Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma ?;Tests that examine the lymph system are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood Hodgkin lymphoma. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the neck, chest, abdomen, or pelvis, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. Sometimes a PET scan and a CT scan are done at the same time. If there is any cancer, this increases the chance that it will be found.    -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:               - The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.      - The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.      - The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.              -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.    -   Sedimentation rate : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the rate at which the red blood cells settle to the bottom of the test tube. The sedimentation rate is a measure of how much inflammation is in the body. A higher than normal sedimentation rate may be a sign of lymphoma. Also called erythrocyte sedimentation rate, sed rate, or ESR.    -   Lymph node biopsy : The removal of all or part of a lymph node. The lymph node may be removed during an image-guided CT scan or a thoracoscopy, mediastinoscopy, or laparoscopy. One of the following types of biopsies may be done:                -  Excisional biopsy : The removal of an entire lymph node.       -  Incisional biopsy : The removal of part of a lymph node.      -  Core biopsy : The removal of tissue from a lymph node using a wide needle.      -  Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy : The removal of tissue from a lymph node using a thin needle.          A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells, especially Reed-Sternberg cells. Reed-Sternberg cells are common in classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The following test may be done on tissue that was removed:               -  Immunophenotyping : A laboratory test used to identify cells, based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell. This test is used to diagnose the specific type of lymphoma by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system.;Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma is a type of cancer that originates in the lymphatic system, a network of vessels and nodes that helps fight infection. Diagnosis typically begins with a thorough medical history and physical examination, including feeling for enlarged lymph nodes. Blood tests may be done to check for abnormalities in blood counts or markers associated with Hodgkin Lymphoma. Imaging tests, such as CT scans or PET scans, are used to identify enlarged lymph nodes or other affected areas. A biopsy, involving the removal of a small tissue sample from an affected lymph node, is performed to confirm the diagnosis and determine the specific subtype of Hodgkin Lymphoma. Additional tests may be done to assess the extent of the disease and plan appropriate treatment.

776;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) multiple familial trichoepithelioma ?;"Multiple familial trichoepithelioma is a condition involving multiple skin tumors that develop from structures associated with the skin (skin appendages), such as hair follicles and sweat glands. People with multiple familial trichoepithelioma typically develop large numbers of smooth, round tumors called trichoepitheliomas, which arise from hair follicles. Trichoepitheliomas are generally noncancerous (benign) but occasionally develop into a type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma.  Individuals with multiple familial trichoepithelioma occasionally also develop other types of tumors, including growths called spiradenomas and cylindromas. Spiradenomas develop in sweat glands. The origin of cylindromas has been unclear; while previously thought to derive from sweat glands, they are now generally believed to begin in hair follicles. Affected individuals are also at increased risk of developing tumors in tissues other than skin appendages, particularly benign or malignant tumors of the salivary glands.  People with multiple familial trichoepithelioma typically begin developing tumors during childhood or adolescence. The tumors mostly appear on the face, especially in the folds in the skin between the nose and lips (nasolabial folds, sometimes called smile lines), but may also occur on the neck, scalp, or trunk. They may grow larger and increase in number over time.  In severe cases, the tumors may get in the way of the eyes, ears, nose, or mouth and affect vision, hearing, or other functions. The growths can be disfiguring and may contribute to depression or other psychological problems. For reasons that are unclear, females with multiple familial trichoepithelioma are often more severely affected than males.";Multiple familial trichoepithelioma is a rare genetic condition characterized by the appearance of multiple small, benign tumors on the face, scalp, and neck. These tumors are typically flesh-colored or slightly pink and can range in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters. Multiple familial trichoepithelioma is usually asymptomatic, but some individuals may experience mild itching or irritation. The exact cause of multiple familial trichoepithelioma is unknown, but it is believed to be caused by a mutation in the CYLD gene. This mutation leads to the overproduction of a protein called cylindromatosis, which is involved in cell growth and differentiation. Multiple familial trichoepithelioma is typically diagnosed based on a physical examination and a biopsy of the tumor. Treatment options may include surgical removal of the tumors, laser therapy, or topical medications.;0.024;236.0;118.0;0.264;0.037;0.16;0.821;0.067;0.01;0.123

The diagnosis of autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) is made on clinical grounds. The key to diagnosis is a detailed history from the affected person, as well as witnesses. Sometimes video-EEG monitoring is necessary. The features that are suggestive of a diagnosis of ADNFLE are: clusters of seizures with a frontal semiology seizures that occur predominantly during sleep normal clinical neurologic exam normal intellect (although reduced intellect, cognitive deficits, or psychiatric disorders may occur) normal findings on neuroimaging ictal EEG (recorded during a seizure) that may be normal or obscured by movement of the cables or electrodes interictal EEG (recorded in between seizures) that shows infrequent epileptiform discharges (distinctive patterns resembling those that occur in people with epilepsy) the presence of the same disorder in other family members, with evidence of autosomal dominant inheritance The diagnosis can be established in a person with the above features, combined with a positive family history and/or genetic testing that detects a mutation in one of the genes known to cause ADNFLE. People who are concerned they may be having seizures or other neurological signs or symptoms should be evaluated by a neurologist.;Diagnosis of autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) involves a comprehensive approach combining clinical findings, detailed medical history, neuroimaging, genetic testing, and electroencephalography (EEG). A thorough history of the patient's seizure episodes, including their frequency, duration, and associated symptoms, is crucial. Neurological examination and assessment of cognitive function help identify any deficits or abnormalities. EEG recordings, particularly during sleep, are essential for capturing characteristic frontal lobe seizure patterns. Genetic testing plays a significant role in confirming the diagnosis by identifying mutations in specific genes, such as CHRNA4, CHRNB2, and GRIN2A, associated with ADNFLE. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are used to rule out other structural abnormalities that may mimic seizures or contribute to the condition. Additionally, long-term video-EEG monitoring may be employed to capture detailed seizure patterns and assess treatment response.;0.072;182.0;129.0;0.39;0.102;0.257;0.844;0.062;0.063;0.058

780;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Cleidocranial dysplasia ?;Cleidocranial dysplasia is a condition that primarily affects the development of the bones and teeth. Characteristic features of this condition include underdeveloped or absent collarbones (clavicles) and delayed closing of the spaces between the bones of the skull (fontanels). Individuals with cleidocranial dysplasia may also have decreased bone density (osteopenia), osteoporosis, dental abnormalities, hearing loss, and recurrent sinus and ear infections. Mutations in the RUNX2 gene cause most cases of cleidocranial dysplasia. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. In some cases, a person inherits cleidocranial dysplasia from a parent who also has the condition. Other cases result from new mutations (de novo mutations) in the RUNX2 gene.  Dental problems are addressed with several procedures. Ear and sinus infections may be treated with antibiotics and use of ear tubes. In some cases surgery is needed for the cranial defect.; Cleidocranial dysplasia, also known as Marie-Sainton syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of bones and teeth. It is characterized by the following features: delayed closure of the skull bones (craniosynostosis), underdeveloped or absent collarbones (clavicles), and widely spaced collarbones. Additionally, people with cleidocranial dysplasia often have short thumbs and fingers, extra ribs, a broad chest, and joint hypermobility. The disorder is caused by mutations in the RUNX2 gene, which is involved in the development of bones and teeth.;0.099;128.0;74.0;0.362;0.172;0.319;0.779;0.247;0.179;0.314
781;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Parasites - Leishmaniasis ?;Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease that is found in parts of the tropics, subtropics, and southern Europe. Leishmaniasis is caused by infection with Leishmania parasites, which are spread by the bite of infected sand flies. There are several different forms of leishmaniasis in people. The most common forms are cutaneous leishmaniasis, which causes skin sores, and visceral leishmaniasis, which affects several internal organs (usually spleen, liver, and bone marrow).;Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne parasitic disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. It is transmitted by the bite of infected female phlebotomine sandflies. The disease has three main clinical forms: visceral leishmaniasis (also known as kala-azar), cutaneous leishmaniasis (oriental sore), and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (espundia). Visceral leishmaniasis is the most severe form of the disease and can be fatal if left untreated. Cutaneous leishmaniasis causes skin lesions that can be disfiguring. Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis affects the mucous membranes of the nose, mouth, and throat and can lead to severe damage. Treatment for leishmaniasis depends on the species of parasite and the clinical form of the disease.;0.053;65.0;95.0;0.36;0.122;0.306;0.843;0.237;0.304;0.169
782;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to microvillus inclusion disease ?;Mutations in the MYO5B gene cause microvillus inclusion disease. The MYO5B gene provides instructions for making a protein called myosin Vb. This protein helps to determine the position of various components within cells (cell polarity). Myosin Vb also plays a role in moving components from the cell membrane to the interior of the cell for recycling.  MYO5B gene mutations that cause microvillus inclusion disease result in a decrease or absence of myosin Vb function. In cells that line the small intestine (enterocytes), a lack of myosin Vb function changes the cell polarity. As a result, enterocytes cannot properly form structures called microvilli, which normally project like small fingers from the surface of the cells and absorb nutrients and fluids from food as it passes through the intestine. Inside affected enterocytes, small clumps of abnormal microvilli mix with misplaced digestive proteins to form microvillus inclusions, which contribute to the dysfunction of enterocytes. Disorganized enterocytes with poorly formed microvilli reduce the intestine's ability to take in nutrients. The inability to absorb nutrients and fluids during digestion leads to recurrent diarrhea, malnutrition, and dehydration in individuals with microvillus inclusion disease.  Some people with the signs and symptoms of microvillus inclusion disease do not have mutations in the MYO5B gene. These cases may be variants of microvillus inclusion disease. Studies suggest that mutations in other genes can cause these cases, but the causes are usually unknown.;Microvillus inclusion disease (MVID) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by severe chronic diarrhea and malabsorption due to the absence or dysfunction of microvilli on the surface of intestinal epithelial cells. The genetic changes associated with MVID primarily involve mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in the formation and maintenance of microvilli. These mutations can affect genes responsible for microvillar actin cytoskeleton organization, apical junctional complex formation, and intracellular trafficking and signaling pathways. Some of the commonly identified genetic alterations include mutations in the MYO5B, EPCAM, STX3, and SLC9A3 genes, among others. These mutations can lead to impaired microvillar structure and function, resulting in the clinical manifestations of MVID.;0.014;210.0;101.0;0.26;0.043;0.187;0.641;0.008;-0.017;0.031
783;gemini-pro;exams and tests;How to diagnose Relapsing polychondritis ?;How is relapsing polychondritis diagnosed? There are no tests available that are specific for relapsing polychondritis (RP). A diagnosis is, therefore, generally based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. For example, people may be diagnosed as having RP if they have three or more of the following features: Inflammation of the cartilage of both ears Seronegative (negative for rheumatoid factor) polyarthritis (arthritis that involves 5 or more joints simultaneously) Inflammation of the cartilage of the nose Eye inflammation (conjunctivitis, episcleritis, scleritis, and/or uveitis) Inflammation of the cartilage of the airway Vestibular dysfunction (i.e. vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus) In some cases, a biopsy of affected tissue may be necessary to support the diagnosis.;Relapsing polychondritis is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by recurrent inflammation of cartilage and other connective tissues in the body. Diagnosis is done through a combination of clinical evaluation, imaging studies, and laboratory tests. Clinical evaluation involves assessing the patient's symptoms, including joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, as well as any associated symptoms such as hearing loss, hoarseness, or eye inflammation. Imaging studies, such as MRI or CT scans, can help identify cartilage inflammation and damage. Laboratory tests, including blood tests and biopsies, can detect the presence of autoantibodies and other markers of inflammation. A definitive diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis requires a combination of clinical findings, imaging results, and laboratory test results.;0.033;104.0;105.0;0.254;0.074;0.141;0.828;-0.019;-0.032;-0.008

785;gemini-pro;treatment;What are the treatments for Broken Heart Syndrome ?;"Even though broken heart syndrome may feel like a heart attack, its a very different problem that needs a different type of treatment.
                
The good news is that broken heart syndrome is usually treatable, and most people make a full recovery. Most people who experience broken heart syndrome stay in the hospital for a few days to a week.
                
Initial treatment is aimed at improving blood flow to the heart, and may be similar to that for a heart attack until the diagnosis is clear. Further treatment can include medicines and lifestyle changes.
                
Medicines
                
Doctors may prescribe medicines to relieve fluid buildup, treat blood pressure problems, prevent blood clots, and manage stress hormones. Medicines are often discontinued once heart function has returned to normal.
                
Your doctor may prescribe the following medicines:
                
ACE inhibitors (or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), to lower blood pressure and reduce strain on your heart
                
Beta blockers, to slow your heart rate and lower your blood pressure to decrease your hearts workload
                
Diuretics (water or fluid pills), to help reduce fluid buildup in your lungs and swelling in your feet and ankles
                
Anti-anxiety medicines, to help manage stress hormones
                
Take all of your medicines as prescribed. If you have side effects or other problems related to your medicines, tell your doctor. He or she may be able to provide other options.
                
Treatment of Complications
                
Broken heart syndrome can be life threatening in some cases. Because the syndrome involves severe heart muscle weakness, patients can experience shock, heart failure, low blood pressure, and potentially life-threatening heart rhythm abnormalities.
                
The good news is that this condition improves very quickly, so with proper diagnosis and management, even the most critically ill tend to make a quick and complete recovery.
                
Lifestyle Changes
                
To stay healthy, its important to find ways to reduce stress and cope with particularly upsetting situations. Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health.
                
Having supportive people in your life with whom you can share your feelings or concerns can help relieve stress. Physical activity, medicine, and relaxation therapy also can help relieve stress. You may want to consider taking part in a stress management program.
                
Treatments Not Helpful for Broken Heart Syndrome
                
Several procedures used to treat a heart attack are not helpful in treating broken heart syndrome. These procedurespercutaneous coronary intervention (sometimes referred to as angioplasty), stent placement, and surgerytreat blocked arteries, which is not the cause of broken heart syndrome.";Treatment for Broken Heart Syndrome, also known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, primarily involves supportive care. Doctors focus on managing the symptoms and complications of the condition. Treatment may include medications to reduce chest pain, such as nitroglycerin or beta-blockers, and diuretics to help reduce fluid retention. In severe cases, mechanical circulatory support devices, such as an intra-aortic balloon pump, may be needed to help the heart pump blood more effectively. Since Broken Heart Syndrome is often a temporary condition, treatment typically focuses on providing support until the heart recovers its normal function. Emotional support and counseling may also be beneficial in helping individuals cope with the emotional stress that may have triggered the condition.;0.007;394.0;105.0;0.285;0.044;0.157;0.689;-0.081;-0.15;-0.014

787;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to mucolipidosis II alpha/beta ?;"Mutations in the GNPTAB gene cause mucolipidosis II alpha/beta. This gene provides instructions for making part of an enzyme called GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. This enzyme helps prepare certain newly made enzymes for transport to lysosomes. Lysosomes are compartments within the cell that use digestive enzymes to break down large molecules into smaller ones that can be reused by cells. GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase is involved in the process of attaching a molecule called mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) to specific digestive enzymes. Just as luggage is tagged at the airport to direct it to the correct destination, enzymes are often ""tagged"" after they are made so they get to where they are needed in the cell. M6P acts as a tag that indicates a digestive enzyme should be transported to the lysosome.  Mutations in the GNPTAB gene that cause mucolipidosis II alpha/beta prevent the production of any functional GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. Without this enzyme, digestive enzymes cannot be tagged with M6P and transported to lysosomes. Instead, they end up outside the cell and have increased digestive activity. The lack of digestive enzymes within lysosomes causes large molecules to accumulate there. Conditions that cause molecules to build up inside lysosomes, including mucolipidosis II alpha/beta, are called lysosomal storage disorders. The signs and symptoms of mucolipidosis II alpha/beta are most likely caused by the lack of digestive enzymes within lysosomes and the effects these enzymes have outside the cell.  Mutations in the GNPTAB gene can also cause a similar but milder disorder called mucolipidosis III alpha/beta. Instead of preventing the production of any enzyme, these mutations reduce the activity of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. Mucolipidosis III alpha/beta and mucolipidosis II alpha/beta represent two ends of a spectrum of disease severity.";Mucolipidosis II alpha/beta, also known as I-cell disease, is an inherited metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the GNPTAB gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase), which is involved in the breakdown of certain sugars. Mutations in the GNPTAB gene lead to a deficiency of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase, resulting in the accumulation of undegraded sugars in cells. This accumulation can interfere with the normal function of cells, leading to a range of symptoms including developmental delays, skeletal abnormalities, coarse facial features, and organ dysfunction.;0.021;251.0;78.0;0.35;0.104;0.197;0.595;0.033;-0.105;0.175

Affected people often have severe intellectual disability with absent speech, and features that resemble Rett syndrome such as hand stereotypies (repetitive movements) and slowed head growth. CDKL5-related disorders have more commonly been reported in females. The inheritance pattern is X-linked dominant. Almost all reported cases have been due to a new mutation in the affected person; one family with 3 affected members has been described. Treatment is symptomatic. In the past, mutations in the CDKL5 gene have been found in people diagnosed with infantile spasms and/or West syndrome; Lennox-Gastaut syndrome; Rett syndrome; a form of atypical Rett syndrome known as the early-onset seizure type; and autism.

794;gemini-pro;causes;What causes Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura ?;"A lack of activity in the ADAMTS13 enzyme (a type of protein in the blood) causes thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The ADAMTS13 gene controls the enzyme, which is involved in blood clotting.
                
Not having enough enzyme activity causes overactive blood clotting. In TTP, blood clots form in small blood vessels throughout the body. These clots can limit or block the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the body's organs, such as the brain, kidneys, and heart. As a result, serious health problems can develop.
                
The increased clotting that occurs in TTP also uses up many of the blood's platelets. With fewer platelets available in the blood, bleeding problems can occur.
                
People who have TTP may bleed inside their bodies, underneath the skin, or from the surface of the skin. When cut or injured, they also may bleed longer than normal.
                
TTP also can cause red blood cells to break apart faster than the body can replace them. This leads to hemolytic anemia.
                
Inherited Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura
                
In inherited TTP, the ADAMTS13 gene is faulty. It doesn't prompt the body to make a normal ADAMTS13 enzyme. As a result, enzyme activity is lacking or changed.
                
""Inherited"" means that the condition is passed from parents to children through genes. A person who inherits TTP is born with two copies of the faulty geneone from each parent.
                
Most often, the parents each have one copy of the faulty gene, but have no signs or symptoms TTP.
                
Acquired Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura
                
In acquired TTP, the ADAMTS13 gene isn't faulty. Instead, the body makes antibodies (proteins) that block the activity of the ADAMTS13 enzyme.
                
""Acquired"" means you aren't born with the condition, but you develop it sometime after birth.
                
Triggers for Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura
                
It's unclear what triggers inherited and acquired TTP, but some factors may play a role. These factors may include:
                
Some diseases and conditions, such as pregnancy, cancer, HIV, lupus, and infections
                
Some medical procedures, such as surgery and blood and marrow stem cell transplant
                
Some medicines, such as chemotherapy, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, cyclosporine A, and hormone therapy and estrogens
                
Quinine, which is a substance often found in tonic water and nutritional health products";Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) is a rare, life-threatening disorder characterized by the formation of small blood clots (microangiopathic hemolytic anemia) in the body's small blood vessels. This occurs due to a deficiency or dysfunction of a specific enzyme called ADAMTS13, which is responsible for cleaving a protein called von Willebrand factor (vWF). The abnormally large vWF multimers can then interact with platelets, leading to platelet aggregation, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), and the formation of microthrombi throughout the body. These microthrombi can obstruct blood flow, resulting in tissue damage and organ dysfunction. The exact cause of the ADAMTS13 deficiency or dysfunction can vary, ranging from autoimmune conditions to genetic mutations or certain medications.;0.008;325.0;101.0;0.27;0.062;0.167;0.792;-0.064;-0.144;0.015

798;gemini-pro;prevention;How to prevent Varicose Veins ?;"You can't prevent varicose veins from forming. However, you can prevent the ones you have from getting worse. You also can take steps to delay other varicose veins from forming.
                
Avoid standing or sitting for long periods without taking a break. When sitting, avoid crossing your legs. Keep your legs raised when sitting, resting, or sleeping. When you can, raise your legs above the level of your heart.
                
Do physical activities to get your legs moving and improve muscle tone. This helps blood move through your veins.
                
If you're overweight or obese, try to lose weight. This will improve blood flow and ease the pressure on your veins.
                
Avoid wearing tight clothes, especially those that are tight around your waist, groin (upper thighs), and legs. Tight clothes can make varicose veins worse.
                
Avoid wearing high heels for long periods. Lower heeled shoes can help tone your calf muscles. Toned muscles help blood move through the veins.
                
Wear compression stockings if your doctor recommends them. These stockings create gentle pressure up the leg. This pressure keeps blood from pooling in the veins and decreases swelling in the legs.";Varicose veins, the bulging and twisted veins, can be prevented by maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly to improve blood circulation, elevating legs when sitting or lying down to reduce pressure on veins, avoiding prolonged standing or sitting, wearing compression stockings to improve blood flow, and adopting a healthy diet rich in fiber and low in sodium to prevent constipation and straining. Additionally, avoiding crossing legs, taking breaks from prolonged sitting or standing, and managing underlying medical conditions like obesity or hormonal imbalances can also help prevent varicose veins. If you have a family history of varicose veins, early intervention and lifestyle modifications can be particularly beneficial.;0.035;179.0;103.0;0.337;0.093;0.157;0.824;0.085;0.039;0.129

                    - Myeloproliferative neoplasms are a group of diseases in which the bone marrow makes too many red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets.     - There are 6 types of chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.    - Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect (find) and diagnose chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.
                
                
                    Myeloproliferative neoplasms are a group of diseases in which the bone marrow makes too many red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets.
                    Normally, the bone marrow makes blood stem cells (immature cells) that become mature blood cells over time.     A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell. A lymphoid stem cell becomes a white blood cell. A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells:         -  Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body.    - White blood cells that fight infection and disease.    -  Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding.          In myeloproliferative neoplasms, too many blood stem cells become one or more types of blood cells. The neoplasms usually get worse slowly as the number of extra blood cells increases.
                
                
                    There are 6 types of chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.
                    The type of myeloproliferative neoplasm is based on whether too many red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets are being made. Sometimes the body will make too many of more than one type of blood cell, but usually one type of blood cell is affected more than the others are. Chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms include the following 6 types:         -  Chronic myelogenous leukemia.    -  Polycythemia vera.    -  Primary myelofibrosis (also called chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis).     -  Essential thrombocythemia.    -  Chronic neutrophilic leukemia.    -  Chronic eosinophilic leukemia.        These types are described below. Chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms sometimes become acute leukemia, in which too many abnormal white blood cells are made.";Chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (CMPNs) are a group of blood cancers that arise from the overproduction of myeloid cells, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. These neoplasms are often characterized by an abnormal increase in one or more of these cell types in the bone marrow and blood, leading to various symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, weight loss, splenomegaly, and abnormal bleeding. CMPNs encompass several distinct disorders, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and myelofibrosis (MF), each with unique clinical features, genetic abnormalities, and treatment approaches. CMPNs can range from indolent conditions with a relatively stable course to aggressive forms that may progress to acute leukemia or pose significant health risks.;0.024;279.0;113.0;0.366;0.106;0.241;0.53;0.022;0.007;0.033

Other symptoms include depression, emotional changes, difficulty swallowing, speech changes, urinary problems, sleep problems, and dementia and other cognitive problems. Parkinson's symptoms usually begin gradually and get worse over time. As the symptoms become more severe, people with the disorder may have difficulty walking, talking, or completing other simple tasks. They also experience non-motor, or movement, symptoms including mental and behavioral changes, sleep problems, depression, memory difficulties, and fatigue. Parkinson's disease not only affects the brain, but the entire body. While the brain involvement is responsible for the core features, other affected locations contribute to the complicated picture of Parkinson's.;Parkinson's Disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement, balance, and coordination. Common symptoms include tremors, rigidity, slowness of movement, and impaired balance. Additionally, individuals may experience changes in speech, sleep, mood, and cognition. Tremors often begin in one hand and can progress to the other side of the body. Rigidity refers to muscle stiffness, making it difficult to move limbs or turn the body. Slowness of movement (bradykinesia) can affect simple tasks like buttoning a shirt or walking. Impaired balance and coordination may lead to falls and difficulty maintaining posture. Other symptoms can include decreased facial expression, difficulty swallowing, soft or slurred speech, sleep disturbances, depression, anxiety, difficulty thinking, and memory problems.;0.028;164.0;108.0;0.419;0.068;0.233;0.843;0.128;0.079;0.175

The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.  Less frequently, this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most of these cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition.  Rarely, cone-rod dystrophy is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. The genes associated with this form of the condition are located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. Females with one copy of the altered gene have mild vision problems, such as decreased visual acuity. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.;Yes, cone-rod dystrophy is an inherited retinal disorder that affects both cone and rod cells in the eye. It is typically passed down in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner, meaning that it can be inherited from one or both parents.

The symptoms vary among affected individuals, and the cause of LCH is unknown. In most cases, this condition is not life-threatening. Some people do experience life-long problems associated with LCH.;Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disease characterized by the abnormal proliferation and accumulation of Langerhans cells, a type of immune cell, in various organs and tissues. It can manifest in various forms, including a single-system involvement, such as isolated bone lesions, or a multi-system involvement, affecting multiple organs simultaneously. Common symptoms may include bone pain, skin rashes, lung involvement causing respiratory issues, liver or spleen enlargement, and diabetes insipidus. The exact cause of LCH is unknown, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treatment options depend on the extent and severity of the disease, ranging from observation and monitoring to chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or targeted therapies.;0.085;96.0;105.0;0.231;0.083;0.163;0.835;0.123;0.164;0.08
813;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) mannose-binding lectin deficiency ?;Mannose-binding lectin deficiency is a condition that affects the immune system. People with this condition have low levels of an immune system protein called mannose-binding lectin in their blood. These individuals are prone to recurrent infections, including infections of the upper respiratory tract and other body systems. People with this condition may also contract more serious infections such as pneumonia and meningitis. Depending on the type of infection, the symptoms caused by the infections vary in frequency and severity.  Infants and young children with mannose-binding lectin deficiency seem to be more susceptible to infections, but adults can also develop recurrent infections. In addition, affected individuals undergoing chemotherapy or taking drugs that suppress the immune system are especially prone to infections.;Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) deficiency is a rare inherited disorder of the immune system in which the body is unable to produce sufficient amounts of mannose-binding lectin, a protein that plays a crucial role in the innate immune response. This deficiency impairs the body's ability to recognize and eliminate certain types of bacteria, viruses, and fungi, making individuals more susceptible to severe and recurrent infections, particularly those caused by encapsulated microorganisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. MBL deficiency can also increase the risk of autoimmune diseases and certain types of cancer.;0.039;112.0;86.0;0.357;0.11;0.214;0.849;0.186;0.268;0.103

817;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to genitopatellar syndrome ?;Genitopatellar syndrome is caused by mutations in the KAT6B gene. This gene provides instructions for making a type of enzyme called a histone acetyltransferase. These enzymes modify histones, which are structural proteins that attach (bind) to DNA and give chromosomes their shape. By adding a small molecule called an acetyl group to histones, histone acetyltransferases control the activity of certain genes. Little is known about the function of the histone acetyltransferase produced from the KAT6B gene. It appears to regulate genes that are important for early development, including development of the skeleton and nervous system.  The mutations that cause genitopatellar syndrome occur near the end of the KAT6B gene and lead to the production of a shortened histone acetyltransferase enzyme. Researchers suspect that the shortened enzyme may function differently than the full-length version, altering the regulation of various genes during early development. However, it is unclear how these changes lead to the specific features of genitopatellar syndrome.;Genitopatellar syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by skeletal and genitourinary abnormalities. It is caused by mutations in the FGFR1 gene, which encodes a protein involved in signal transduction. FGFR1 mutations can result in the production of a non-functional protein, which leads to the characteristic features of the syndrome. These features include abnormal development of the thumbs and big toes, joint contractures, and delayed bone growth. Additionally, affected individuals may have kidney and urinary tract abnormalities, as well as intellectual disability. The severity of the disorder can vary significantly between individuals, even those with the same mutation.;0.044;138.0;87.0;0.234;0.093;0.182;0.613;0.022;-0.032;0.074

The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - The stage of the cancer (the size of the tumor, whether it affects part or all of the liver, or has spread to other places in the body).    - How well the liver is working.    - The patients general health, including whether there is cirrhosis of the liver.;The outlook for adult primary liver cancer is highly variable and depends on several factors, including the stage of the cancer, the patient's overall health, and the type of treatment received. For patients with early-stage liver cancer, surgical removal of the tumor may be curative. However, for patients with advanced-stage liver cancer, the outlook is generally poor, with a median survival time of less than a year. Treatment options for advanced-stage liver cancer include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. These treatments can help to shrink the tumor and relieve symptoms, but they are rarely curative. Liver transplantation may be an option for some patients with advanced-stage liver cancer, but this is a major surgery with significant risks.;0.025;57.0;107.0;0.275;0.056;0.165;0.663;-0.028;0.005;-0.064

It is characterized by sparse, kinky hair; failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive); and deterioration of the nervous system. Additional signs and symptoms include weak muscle tone (hypotonia), sagging facial features, seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. Children with Menkes syndrome typically begin to develop symptoms during infancy and often do not live past age 3. Early treatment with copper may improve the prognosis in some affected individuals. In rare cases, symptoms begin later in childhood.  Occipital horn syndrome (sometimes called X-linked cutis laxa) is a less severe form of Menkes syndrome that begins in early to middle childhood. It is characterized by wedge-shaped calcium deposits in a bone at the base of the skull (the occipital bone), coarse hair, and loose skin and joints.";Menkes syndrome, also known as Menkes kinky hair syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder that primarily affects males and is caused by mutations in the ATP7A gene. This gene encodes a copper-transporting ATPase protein, and its dysfunction leads to impaired copper absorption and utilization in the body. As a result, individuals with Menkes syndrome exhibit a range of symptoms, including distinctive kinky hair, intellectual disability, seizures, growth failure, and connective tissue abnormalities. The condition typically presents in early infancy and is often fatal within the first decade of life due to complications such as respiratory infections and neurological deterioration.

826;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to sick sinus syndrome ?;Sick sinus syndrome can result from genetic or environmental factors. In many cases, the cause of the condition is unknown.  Genetic changes are an uncommon cause of sick sinus syndrome. Mutations in two genes, SCN5A and HCN4, have been found to cause the condition in a small number of families. These genes provide instructions for making proteins called ion channels that transport positively charged atoms (ions) into cardiac cells, including cells that make up the SA node. The flow of these ions is essential for creating the electrical impulses that start each heartbeat and coordinate contraction of the cardiac muscle. Mutations in these genes reduce the flow of ions, which alters the SA node's ability to create and spread electrical signals. These changes lead to abnormal heartbeats and the other symptoms of sick sinus syndrome.  A particular variation in another gene, MYH6, appears to increase the risk of developing sick sinus syndrome. The protein produced from the MYH6 gene forms part of a larger protein called myosin, which generates the mechanical force needed for cardiac muscle to contract. Researchers believe that the MYH6 gene variation changes the structure of myosin, which can affect cardiac muscle contraction and increase the likelihood of developing an abnormal heartbeat.  More commonly, sick sinus syndrome is caused by other factors that alter the structure or function of the SA node. These include a variety of heart conditions, other disorders such as muscular dystrophy, abnormal inflammation, or a shortage of oxygen (hypoxia). Certain medications, such as drugs given to treat abnormal heart rhythms or high blood pressure, can also disrupt SA node function. One of the most common causes of sick sinus syndrome in children is trauma to the SA node, such as damage that occurs during heart surgery.  In older adults, sick sinus syndrome is often associated with age-related changes in the heart. Over time, the SA node may harden and develop scar-like damage (fibrosis) that prevents it from working properly.;Sick sinus syndrome (SSS) is a heart rhythm disorder characterized by the inability of the sinoatrial node (SA node) to generate electrical impulses effectively, leading to slow heart rate and pauses. Several genetic changes have been identified as potential causes of SSS, including mutations in genes encoding ion channels, such as SCN5A, HCN4, and KCNQ1, which are involved in the generation and conduction of electrical impulses in the heart. Mutations in genes related to calcium handling, such as CACNA1C and CASQ2, have also been implicated in the development of SSS. Additionally, genetic variations in genes involved in fibrosis and inflammation, such as TGF-beta and IL-6, have been associated with an increased risk of SSS. These genetic changes can disrupt the normal electrical properties and structure of the heart, leading to the symptoms observed in SSS.;0.011;296.0;125.0;0.343;0.08;0.167;0.797;0.086;-0.011;0.183

In general, OPCA is a slowly progressive disorder, meaning that symptoms may worsen gradually over time. The rate of progression can be influenced by factors such as the genetic mutation causing the condition, the age of onset, and the individual's overall health. While there is currently no cure for OPCA, there are treatments available to help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. These may include medications, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. In some cases, surgery may be an option to treat specific symptoms. Regular monitoring by a healthcare professional is important to track the progression of the condition and adjust treatment as needed.

It is typically diagnosed in young children, but older children and adults can also develop this condition. Kawasaki syndrome often begins with a fever that lasts at least 5 days. Other classic symptoms may include red eyes, lips, and mouth; rash; swollen and red hands and feet; and swollen lymph nodes. Sometimes the condition affects the coronary arteries (which carry oxygen-rich blood to the heart). This can lead to serious heart problems. Kawasaki syndrome occurs most often in people of Asian and Pacific Island descent. The cause of Kawasaki disease is unknown. An infection along with genetic factors may be involved. Treatment includes intravenous gamma globulin and high doses of aspirin in a hospital setting.";Kawasaki syndrome is a rare inflammatory disorder that primarily affects young children under the age of 5. It is characterized by a high fever, rash, swollen lymph nodes, red and cracked lips, red and swollen hands and feet, and conjunctivitis. The exact cause of Kawasaki syndrome is unknown, but it is thought to be triggered by an infection. Treatment typically involves high doses of aspirin and intravenous immunoglobulin, which can help reduce inflammation and prevent serious complications such as heart problems.

837;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) laryngo-onycho-cutaneous syndrome ?;"Laryngo-onycho-cutaneous (LOC) syndrome is a disorder that leads to abnormalities of the voicebox (laryngo-), finger- and toenails (onycho-), and skin (cutaneous). Many of the condition's signs and symptoms are related to the abnormal growth of granulation tissue in different parts of the body. This red, bumpy tissue is normally produced during wound healing and is usually replaced by skin cells as healing continues. However, in people with LOC syndrome, this tissue grows even when there is no major injury.  One of the first symptoms in infants with LOC syndrome is a hoarse cry due to ulcers or overgrowth of granulation tissue in the voicebox (the larynx). Excess granulation tissue can also block the airways, leading to life-threatening breathing problems; as a result many affected individuals do not survive past childhood.  In LOC syndrome, granulation tissue also grows in the eyes, specifically the conjunctiva, which are the moist tissues that line the eyelids and the white part of the eyes. Affected individuals often have impairment or complete loss of vision due to the tissue overgrowth.  Another common feature of LOC syndrome is missing patches of skin (cutaneous erosions). The erosions heal slowly and may become infected. People with LOC syndrome can also have malformed nails and small, abnormal teeth. The hard, white material that forms the protective outer layer of each tooth (enamel) is thin, which contributes to frequent cavities.  LOC syndrome is typically considered a subtype of another skin condition called junctional epidermolysis bullosa, which is characterized by fragile skin that blisters easily. While individuals with junctional epidermolysis bullosa can have some of the features of LOC syndrome, they do not usually have overgrowth of granulation tissue in the conjunctiva.";Laryngo-onycho-cutaneous syndrome is an extremely rare genetic condition characterized by a triad of symptoms including laryngeal papillomatosis, nail dystrophy, and skin abnormalities. Laryngeal papillomatosis involves the growth of non-cancerous tumors within the larynx, leading to hoarseness, breathing difficulties, and recurrent infections. Nail dystrophy manifests as brittle, discolored, and deformed nails. Skin abnormalities include thickened skin, excessive sweating, and the formation of cysts and tumors. The condition is caused by mutations in the LEPRE1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that only one copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the disorder. Treatment typically involves surgical removal of laryngeal papillomas, nail care, and management of skin symptoms.;0.005;256.0;102.0;0.216;0.043;0.141;0.672;-0.09;-0.153;-0.028

It is primarily caused by mutations in the transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGFB1) gene, located on chromosome 19. This gene provides instructions for producing a protein that plays a vital role in regulating bone growth and remodeling. Mutations in the TGFB1 gene disrupt the normal function of this protein, leading to the excessive formation and accumulation of bone tissue. Camurati-Engelmann disease is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that only one copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the condition. However, cases of autosomal recessive inheritance, requiring two copies of the mutated gene, have also been reported.;0.059;23.0;108.0;0.309;0.145;0.268;0.567;0.131;0.373;-0.093

Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs although a variety of species may be infected. Organisms are excreted in birth fluids, milk, urine, and feces of infected animals and are able to survive for long periods in the environment. Infection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms from air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected animals. Other modes of transmission to humans, including tick bites, ingestion of unpasteurized milk or dairy products, and human to human transmission, are rare. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very few organisms may be required to cause infection. In less than 5% of cases the affected people with acute Q fever infection develop a chronic Q fever. Treatment of the acute form is made with antibiotics. The chronic form's treatment depend on the symptoms.;Q fever is a bacterial infection caused by Coxiella burnetii, a highly infectious and resilient bacterium. It can be transmitted to humans through contact with infected animals or their products, such as unpasteurized milk, or through inhalation of contaminated aerosols. Symptoms of Q fever can range from mild, flu-like illness (fever, fatigue, headache, and muscle aches) to severe pneumonia, hepatitis, or even meningitis. Infection can be acute or chronic, and some individuals may experience long-term fatigue and other symptoms. Diagnosis is made through blood tests, and treatment typically involves antibiotics.

Pityriasis lichenoides chronica usually starts out as a small pink papule that turns a reddish-brown color. There is usually a fine, mica-like adherent scale attached to the center which can be peeled off to reveal a shiny, pinkish brown surface. Over several weeks, the spot flattens out spontaneously and leaves behind a brown mark, which fades over several months. Pityriasis lichenoides chronica most commonly occurs over the trunk, buttocks, arms and legs, but may also occur on the hands, feet, face and scalp. Unlike the acute type of pityriasis lichenoides, lesions associated with pityriasis lichenoides chronica are not painful, itchy or irritating. What symptoms are associated with pityriasis lichenoides chronica (PLC)? PLC is the milder form of pityriasis lichenoides, and the lesions associated with this form consist of small, firm, red-brown spots.

                    The prostate is a gland in the male reproductive system. It lies just below the bladder (the organ that collects and empties urine) and in front of the rectum (the lower part of the intestine). It is about the size of a walnut and surrounds part of the urethra (the tube that empties urine from the bladder). The prostate gland makes fluid that is part of the semen.      Prostate cancer is most common in older men. In the U.S., about 1 out of 5 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer.";Prostate cancer is a common type of cancer that affects men. It starts in the prostate gland, which is located just below the bladder and in front of the rectum. The prostate gland produces fluid that helps to nourish and protect sperm. Prostate cancer occurs when cells in the prostate gland start to grow out of control. These cells can form a tumor in the prostate gland, which can cause problems with urination, ejaculation, and sexual function. Prostate cancer can also spread to other parts of the body, such as the bones, lungs, and liver.;0.054;142.0;85.0;0.356;0.113;0.237;0.787;0.112;0.068;0.154

858;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Pinworms ?;Pinworms are small parasites that can live in the colon and rectum. You get them when you swallow their eggs. The eggs hatch inside your intestines. While you sleep, the female pinworms leave the intestines through the anus and lay eggs on nearby skin.    Pinworms spread easily. When people who are infected touch their anus, the eggs attach to their fingertips. They can spread the eggs to others directly through their hands, or through contaminated clothing, bedding, food, or other articles. The eggs can live on household surfaces for up to 2 weeks.    The infection is more common in children. Many people have no symptoms at all. Some people feel itching around the anus or vagina. The itching may become intense, interfere with sleep, and make you irritable.    Your health care provider can diagnose pinworm infection by finding the eggs. A common way to collect the eggs is with a sticky piece of clear tape. Mild infections may not need treatment. If you do need medicine, everyone in the household should take it.     To prevent becoming infected or reinfected with pinworms,       - Bathe after waking up    - Wash your pajamas and bed sheets often    - Wash your hands regularly, especially after using the bathroom or changing diapers    - Change your underwear every day    - Avoid nail biting    - Avoid scratching the anal area       NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases;Pinworms are tiny, thread-like intestinal parasites that commonly infect humans, particularly children. They are typically white or off-white in color and measure about 1/4 to 1/2 inch in length. Pinworms live in the large intestine and feed on the contents of the bowel, causing itching and irritation in the anal area, especially at night. The most common symptom of pinworm infection is anal itching, which can be intense and disruptive to sleep. Infection can also cause abdominal pain, nausea, and loss of appetite. Pinworms are spread through the ingestion of microscopic pinworm eggs, which are found in contaminated soil, food, and water, or through direct contact with an infected person.;0.009;207.0;103.0;0.295;0.046;0.147;0.799;0.077;-0.014;0.167

In people with this condition, one or both eyes may be very small or poorly developed (microphthalmia). Affected individuals also typically have unusual linear skin markings on the head and neck. These markings follow the paths along which cells migrate as the skin develops before birth (lines of Blaschko). The skin defects generally improve over time and leave variable degrees of scarring.  The signs and symptoms of microphthalmia with linear skin defects syndrome vary widely, even among affected individuals within the same family. In addition to the characteristic eye problems and skin markings, this condition can cause abnormalities in the brain, heart, and genitourinary system.

An ischemic stroke is caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. The other kind of stroke is called hemorrhagic stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke is caused by a blood vessel that breaks and bleeds into the brain.;A stroke, also known as a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), occurs when blood supply to a part of the brain is interrupted or reduced, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients. This lack of blood flow can cause brain cells to die, leading to a range of symptoms depending on the location and severity of the stroke. Strokes are often classified into two main types: ischemic strokes, which are caused by a blockage in an artery supplying blood to the brain, and hemorrhagic strokes, which are caused by a rupture or leak in a blood vessel in the brain. The symptoms of a stroke can vary widely, but may include sudden weakness or numbness on one side of the body, difficulty speaking or understanding speech, vision problems, dizziness, and loss of balance or coordination. If you or someone you know experiences any of these symptoms, it is essential to seek immediate medical attention, as prompt treatment can help to minimize brain damage and improve outcomes.;0.031;60.0;148.0;0.265;0.053;0.191;0.641;0.113;0.264;-0.032
865;gemini-pro;exams and tests;How to diagnose Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia ?;Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect (find) and diagnose adult AML. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.     -   Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:                - The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.      - The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.      - The portion of the sample made up of red blood cells.             -   Peripheral blood smear : A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked for blast cells, the number and kinds of white blood cells, the number of platelets, and changes in the shape of blood cells.     -   Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : The removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone. A pathologist views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer.     -   Cytogenetic analysis : A laboratory test in which the cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes. Other tests, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), may also be done to look for certain changes in the chromosomes.    -   Immunophenotyping : A process used to identify cells, based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell. This process is used to diagnose the subtype of AML by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system. For example, a cytochemistry study may test the cells in a sample of tissue using chemicals (dyes) to look for certain changes in the sample. A chemical may cause a color change in one type of leukemia cell but not in another type of leukemia cell.    -   Reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction test (RTPCR): A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are studied using chemicals to look for certain changes in the structure or function of genes. This test is used to diagnose certain types of AML including acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).;"Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) diagnosis involves a comprehensive evaluation of clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, and specific tests:

1. **Medical History and Physical Examination:**
   - Detailed medical history including symptoms like fatigue, unexplained weight loss, bone pain, bleeding, bruising, or enlarged lymph nodes.
   - Physical examination to assess general health, signs of infection, skin changes, lymph node enlargement, or splenomegaly.

2. **Complete Blood Count (CBC) and Peripheral Blood Smear:**
   - CBC reveals abnormal blood cell counts, including low red blood cell (anemia), platelet (thrombocytopenia), and white blood cell (leukocytosis) counts.
   - Peripheral blood smear examination helps identify abnormal immature blasts, reduced normal cell lines, and morphologic features suggestive of AML.

3. **Bone Marrow Aspiration and Biopsy:**
   - Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are crucial diagnostic procedures.
   - Aspiration provides a sample of bone marrow for cytology and flow cytometry studies, allowing identification of leukemia cells.
   - Biopsy provides tissue samples for histopathology, aiding in diagnosis andサブタイプ分類.

4. **Flow Cytometry:**
   - Flow cytometry analyzes the expression of specific cell surface markers on bone marrow cells.
   - This technique helps distinguish AML from other types of leukemia and identifies specific genetic abnormalities associated with AML.

5. **Cytogenetics and Molecular Studies:**
   - Cytogenetic analysis examines chromosome abnormalities associated with AML, providing prognostic information.
   - Molecular studies like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) detect specific gene mutations associated with AML, further aiding in diagnosis and guiding targeted therapy decisions.";0.038;346.0;224.0;0.338;0.086;0.216;0.665;0.015;0.001;0.025
866;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is Norrie disease inherited ?;This condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation must be present in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.  In X-linked recessive inheritance, a female with one altered copy of the gene in each cell is called a carrier. She can pass on the gene, but generally does not experience signs and symptoms of the disorder. In rare cases, however, carrier females have shown some retinal abnormalities or mild hearing loss associated with Norrie disease.;Yes, Norrie disease is an inherited condition caused by mutations in the NDP gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called norrin, which is involved in the development of the eyes and ears. Mutations in the NDP gene disrupt the production or function of norrin, leading to the symptoms of Norrie disease. It is typically passed down in an X-linked recessive pattern, meaning that it is carried on the X chromosome and males are more commonly affected than females. In rare cases, Norrie disease can be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that both copies of the gene must be mutated to cause the condition.;0.069;145.0;95.0;0.493;0.179;0.2;0.698;0.145;0.108;0.179

1. Genetic Research: Ongoing studies aim to identify the genetic variations associated with different types of NF, such as NF1 and NF2, to gain insights into the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.

2. Clinical Trials for NF1: Several clinical trials are evaluating the efficacy and safety of various therapies for NF1, including targeted therapies like selumetinib and trametinib, which inhibit the MEK pathway, and drugs that aim to reduce tumor growth and improve symptoms.

3. Clinical Trials for NF2: Clinical trials are investigating the potential of targeted therapies such as pazopanib and sorafenib in treating NF2-related tumors. Researchers are also exploring the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors to enhance the body's immune response against NF2 tumors.

4. Novel Treatment Approaches: Researchers are exploring innovative treatment strategies like gene therapy, which aims to introduce functional genes to compensate for genetic defects causing NF. Additionally, studies are investigating the use of neurofibromin mimetics, which mimic the activity of the missing neurofibromin protein, as a potential therapeutic approach.

5. Natural Product Research: Investigations are ongoing to evaluate the potential of natural compounds, including curcumin and resveratrol, in managing NF symptoms and potentially inhibiting tumor growth.

These research efforts and clinical trials collectively strive to advance the understanding of NF, identify effective treatments, and improve the quality of life for individuals affected by this condition.";0.013;197.0;227.0;0.281;0.03;0.125;0.729;0.076;0.088;0.061

871;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Benign Tumors ?;Tumors are abnormal growths in your body. They are made up of extra cells. Normally, cells grow and divide to form new cells as your body needs them. When cells grow old, they die, and new cells take their place. Sometimes, this process goes wrong. New cells form when your body does not need them, and old cells do not die when they should. When these extra cells form a mass, it is called a tumor.    Tumors can be either benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer. Malignant ones are. Benign tumors grow only in one place. They cannot spread or invade other parts of your body. Even so, they can be dangerous if they press on vital organs, such as your brain.    Treatment often involves surgery. Benign tumors usually don't grow back.    NIH: National Cancer Institute;Benign tumors are abnormal growths of cells that do not invade surrounding tissues or spread to other parts of the body. They are typically slow-growing and do not cause any symptoms unless they become large enough to press on nearby organs or tissues. Common examples of benign tumors include moles, skin tags, uterine fibroids, and breast cysts. Treatment for benign tumors may involve surgical removal, medication, or observation if they are not causing any problems.;0.04;135.0;74.0;0.338;0.115;0.279;0.743;0.081;0.035;0.124

To date, the most effective treatment for Madelung disease is surgery which may include surgical excision (removal) and/or liposuction. Liposuction has gained popularity in more recent years since it results in minimal scarring. It is also considered less invasive, technically easier, and better suited for people with a higher surgical or anaesthetic risk. Some researchers believe it is unnecessary to subject affected people to the risks of surgery because the condition is usually benign. In their opinion, surgical excision should be limited to those with airway compression or severe physical deformities. The limitations of liposuction include incomplete removal of lipomas. The main disadvantage of surgical excision is the scarring; however, it offers the chance of more extensive ""debulking"" of affected areas. Reportedly, it is rarely possible to remove the lipomas completely and they often recur after both of these procedures.

883;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency ?;"Peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency is caused by mutations in the ACOX1 gene, which provides instructions for making an enzyme called peroxisomal straight-chain acyl-CoA oxidase. This enzyme is found in sac-like cell structures (organelles) called peroxisomes, which contain a variety of enzymes that break down many different substances. The peroxisomal straight-chain acyl-CoA oxidase enzyme plays a role in the breakdown of certain fat molecules called very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). Specifically, it is involved in the first step of a process called the peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway. This process shortens the VLCFA molecules by two carbon atoms at a time until the VLCFAs are converted to a molecule called acetyl-CoA, which is transported out of the peroxisomes for reuse by the cell.  ACOX1 gene mutations prevent the peroxisomal straight-chain acyl-CoA oxidase enzyme from breaking down VLCFAs efficiently. As a result, these fatty acids accumulate in the body. It is unclear exactly how VLCFA accumulation leads to the specific features of peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency. However, researchers suggest that the abnormal fatty acid accumulation triggers inflammation in the nervous system that leads to the breakdown of myelin, which is the covering that protects nerves and promotes the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. Destruction of myelin leads to a loss of myelin-containing tissue (white matter) in the brain and spinal cord; loss of white matter is described as leukodystrophy. Leukodystrophy is likely involved in the development of the neurological abnormalities that occur in peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency.";"Peroxisomal Acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency (PAOX), a rare inherited disorder, is characterized by mutations in the encoding gene ACOX1.

This enzyme plays a crucial role in breaking down and metabolizing specific fatty acids known as ""very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs)"". Genetic changes in ACOX1 can lead to the production of a defective or non-functional enzyme, resulting in the accumulation of VLCFAs in the body. These accumulated VLCFAs can be toxic to cells, particularly those in the brain, liver, and muscles, leading to a range of clinical manifestations, including neurological problems, liver dysfunction, and heart abnormalities. Understanding these genetic alterations is essential for diagnosis, genetic counseling, and potential development of targeted therapies for PAOX.";0.05;217.0;120.0;0.377;0.137;0.28;0.795;0.202;0.122;0.282
884;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to epidermolysis bullosa simplex ?;The four major types of epidermolysis bullosa simplex can result from mutations in either the KRT5 or KRT14 gene. These genes provide instructions for making proteins called keratin 5 and keratin 14. These tough, fibrous proteins work together to provide strength and resiliency to the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis). Mutations in either the KRT5 or KRT14 gene prevent the keratin proteins from assembling into strong networks, causing cells in the epidermis to become fragile and easily damaged. As a result, the skin is less resistant to friction and minor trauma and blisters easily. In rare cases, no KRT5 or KRT14 gene mutations are identified in people with one of the four major types of epidermolysis bullosa simplex.  Mutations in another gene, PLEC, have been associated with the rare Ogna type of epidermolysis bullosa simplex. The PLEC gene provides instructions for making a protein called plectin, which helps attach the epidermis to underlying layers of skin. Researchers are working to determine how PLEC gene mutations lead to the major features of the condition.;Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is a group of inherited skin disorders characterized by fragile skin that blisters and peels in response to minor friction or trauma. It is caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins that are essential for the structure and function of the skin. The most common type of EBS, known as EBS simplex, is caused by mutations in the keratin 5 (KRT5) and keratin 14 (KRT14) genes. These genes encode proteins that are components of the intermediate filaments in the skin cells, which provide structural support and mechanical strength to the skin. Mutations in these genes result in the production of defective keratin proteins, leading to weakened skin that is prone to blistering and erosion. Other types of EBS, such as EBS Dowling-Meara and EBS Ogna, are caused by mutations in other genes involved in skin structure and function, such as the plectin (PLEC) and collagen type XVII (COL17A1) genes.;0.034;158.0;143.0;0.448;0.086;0.242;0.877;0.18;0.17;0.187

Intrauterine insemination (IUI) and in vitro fertilization (IVF) are commonly utilized techniques to facilitate fertilization. Additionally, lifestyle modifications such as maintaining a healthy weight, engaging in regular exercise, and reducing stress may improve sperm quality. In some cases, medications like phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i) may be prescribed to enhance erectile function and sperm parameters. Ongoing research is exploring gene therapy and other novel approaches to address the underlying genetic cause, but these therapies are still in early stages of development and not widely available.;0.029;65.0;102.0;0.169;0.038;0.138;0.571;-0.115;-0.085;-0.148
886;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) isolated Duane retraction syndrome ?;"Isolated Duane retraction syndrome is a disorder of eye movement. This condition prevents outward movement of the eye (toward the ear), and in some cases may also limit inward eye movement (toward the nose). As the eye moves inward, the eyelids partially close and the eyeball pulls back (retracts) into its socket. Most commonly, only one eye is affected. About 10 percent of people with isolated Duane retraction syndrome develop amblyopia (""lazy eye""), a condition that causes vision loss in the affected eye.  About 70 percent of all cases of Duane retraction syndrome are isolated, which means they occur without other signs and symptoms. Duane retraction syndrome can also occur as part of syndromes that affect other areas of the body. For example, Duane-radial ray syndrome is characterized by this eye disorder in conjunction with abnormalities of bones in the arms and hands.  Researchers have identified three forms of isolated Duane retraction syndrome, designated types I, II, and III. The types vary in which eye movements are most severely restricted (inward, outward, or both). All three types are characterized by retraction of the eyeball as the eye moves inward.";Duane retraction syndrome (DRS) is a rare congenital eye movement disorder characterized by limited horizontal eye movement, retraction of the eyeball into the socket, and narrowing of the eyelid opening upon attempted adduction (movement of the eye towards the nose). Isolated DRS affects only one eye, while bilateral DRS affects both eyes. Isolated DRS may be caused by mutations in various genes, including CHN1, SIX3, SIX5, and SALL4. It can also be associated with other conditions such as Goldenhar syndrome and CHARGE syndrome. Treatment for isolated DRS typically involves eyeglasses or contact lenses to correct refractive errors, prisms to improve eye alignment, and/or surgery to improve eye movement and eyelid function.;0.029;175.0;105.0;0.324;0.087;0.208;0.797;0.077;0.061;0.089
887;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Renal tubular acidosis with deafness ?;Renal tubular acidosis with deafness is characterized by kidney (renal) problems and sensorineural hearing loss. Infants with this condition may have problems with feeding and gaining weight (failure to thrive). Most children and adults with the condition have short stature, and many develop kidney stones. Other less common features include a softening and weakening of the bones and hypokalemic paralysis (extreme muscle weakness associated with low levels of potassium in the blood). Renal tubular acidosis with deafness is caused by mutations in the ATP6V1B1 or ATP6V0A4 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate can reduce or prevent many of the symptoms of this condition.;Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) with deafness is a rare genetic disorder characterized by defective acid secretion in the renal tubules, leading to an accumulation of acid in the blood (metabolic acidosis) and loss of bicarbonate in the urine. This can result in a variety of symptoms, including dehydration, growth problems, kidney stones, and hearing loss. There are several different types of RTA with deafness, each caused by a different genetic mutation. Treatment typically involves medications to correct the metabolic acidosis and hearing aids or cochlear implants to address the hearing loss.;0.042;106.0;82.0;0.388;0.115;0.279;0.813;0.125;0.051;0.199

You may need more light for reading and other tasks. Dry AMD generally affects both eyes, but vision can be lost in one eye while the other eye seems unaffected. One of the most common early signs of dry AMD is drusen. Drusen are yellow deposits under the retina. They often are found in people over age 50. Your eye care professional can detect drusen during a comprehensive dilated eye exam.;Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common eye condition that affects the central part of the retina, called the macula, which is responsible for sharp, central vision. Symptoms of AMD include blurred vision, especially in the center of the field of vision, difficulty recognizing faces or objects, trouble reading or driving, distorted or wavy vision, and a dark or empty spot in the center of the field of vision. In the early stages, AMD may cause no noticeable symptoms, but as the condition progresses, symptoms typically worsen and can lead to significant vision loss. Regular eye exams are important for early detection and monitoring of AMD, as early intervention can help slow the progression of the disease and preserve vision.;0.026;83.0;107.0;0.321;0.045;0.229;0.575;0.049;0.039;0.055

891;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Urinary Incontinence in Men ?;"The urinary tract is the bodys drainage system for removing urine, which is composed of wastes and extra fluid. In order for normal urination to occur, all parts in the urinary tract need to work together in the correct order.
                
Kidneys. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine. The kidneys work around the clock; a person does not control what they do.
                
Ureters. Ureters are the thin tubes of muscleone on each side of the bladderthat carry urine from each of the kidneys to the bladder.
                
Bladder. The bladder, located in the pelvis between the pelvic bones, is a hollow, muscular, balloon-shaped organ that expands as it fills with urine. Although a person does not control kidney function, a person does control when the bladder empties. Bladder emptying is known as urination. The bladder stores urine until the person finds an appropriate time and place to urinate. A normal bladder acts like a reservoir and can hold 1.5 to 2 cups of urine. How often a person needs to urinate depends on how quickly the kidneys produce the urine that fills the bladder. The muscles of the bladder wall remain relaxed while the bladder fills with urine. As the bladder fills to capacity, signals sent to the brain tell a person to find a toilet soon. During urination, the bladder empties through the urethra, located at the bottom of the bladder.
                
Three sets of muscles work together like a dam, keeping urine in the bladder between trips to the bathroom.
                
The first set is the muscles of the urethra itself. The area where the urethra joins the bladder is the bladder neck. The bladder neck, composed of the second set of muscles known as the internal sphincter, helps urine stay in the bladder. The third set of muscles is the pelvic floor muscles, also referred to as the external sphincter, which surround and support the urethra.
                
To urinate, the brain signals the muscular bladder wall to tighten, squeezing urine out of the bladder. At the same time, the brain signals the sphincters to relax. As the sphincters relax, urine exits the bladder through the urethra.";Urinary incontinence in men is the involuntary leakage of urine. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including prostate enlargement, nerve damage, and weak pelvic floor muscles. Symptoms can range from occasional dribbling to complete loss of bladder control. Treatment options depend on the underlying cause and may include medication, surgery, or lifestyle changes.;0.0;326.0;53.0;0.151;0.023;0.104;0.434;-0.256;-0.392;-0.116

If the infection is widespread or the person appears seriously ill, treatment is started immediately. Voriconazole is currently first-line treatment for invasive aspergillosis and is usually given intravenously. There are other antifungal drugs that can be used to treat invasive aspergillosis in patients who cannot take voriconazole or who have not responded to voriconazole. These include itraconazole, lipid amphotericin formulations, caspofungin, micafungin, and posaconazole. Whenever possible, immunosuppressive medications should be discontinued or decreased. A fungus ball usually does not require treatment unless bleeding into the lung tissue is associated with the infection, then surgery is required. Antifungal agents do not help people with allergic aspergillosis. Allergic aspergillosis is treated with prednisone taken by mouth.;Treatment for aspergillosis depends on the type and severity of the infection. For allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, treatment may include oral corticosteroids or antifungal medications. For invasive aspergillosis, treatment typically involves intravenous antifungal medications, such as voriconazole, isavuconazole, or caspofungin. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove infected tissue or to drain a lung abscess. For chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, treatment may include antifungal medications, surgery, or a combination of both.

895;gemini-pro;causes;What causes Wilson Disease ?;"Wilson disease is caused by an inherited autosomal recessive mutation, or change, in the ATP7B gene. In an autosomal recessive disease, the child has to inherit the gene mutation from both parents to have an increased likelihood for the disease. The chance of a child inheriting autosomal recessive mutations from both parents with a gene mutation is 25 percent, or one in four. If only one parent carries the mutated gene, the child will not get the disease, although the child may inherit one copy of the gene mutation. The child is called a carrier of the disease and can pass the gene mutation to the next generation. Genetic testing is a procedure that identifies changes in a patients genes and can show whether a parent or child is a carrier of a mutated gene. Autosomal recessive diseases are typically not seen in every generation of an affected family.
                
The following chart shows the chance of inheriting an autosomal recessive mutation from parents who both carry the mutated gene.
                

                
Genetic Diseases   Each cell contains thousands of genes that provide the instructions for making proteins for growth and repair of the body. If a gene has a mutation, the protein made by that gene may not function properly. Not all gene mutations cause a disease.   People have two copies of most genes; they inherit one copy from each parent. A genetic disease occurs when one or both parents pass a mutated gene to a child at conception. A genetic disease can also occur through a spontaneous gene mutation, meaning neither parent carries a copy of the mutated gene. Once a spontaneous gene mutation has occurred in a person, that person can pass the gene mutation on to a child.

This mutation prevents the body from properly regulating copper metabolism, leading to excessive copper accumulation in the liver, brain, and other organs. The buildup of copper can cause liver damage, neurological abnormalities, psychiatric symptoms, and impaired kidney function. It can also lead to the formation of Kayser-Fleischer rings, a golden-brown ring around the cornea of the eye.

The pituitary gland normally makes several hormones (including growth hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, prolactin, follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, vasopressin, and oxytocin).  These hormones are important for directing body growth and development, and for regulating blood pressure and metabolism.  Symptoms of this condition vary and depend on which hormones are affected.  Treatment depends on the cause of this condition; once the cause is corrected, medication (hormone replacement therapy) must be taken to provide the body with the normal amount of hormones.";Hypopituitarism, also known as pituitary insufficiency, is a medical condition characterized by the underproduction of one or more hormones by the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland, located at the base of the brain, produces hormones essential for various bodily functions, including growth, metabolism, thyroid function, reproduction, and stress response. Causes of hypopituitarism may include tumors, head injuries, infections, autoimmune disorders, and genetic mutations. Symptoms can vary depending on which hormones are affected, but may involve fatigue, weight loss, impaired growth, delayed or absent puberty, infertility, sensitivity to cold, and menstrual irregularities. Treatment involves hormone replacement therapy to supplement the hormones that the pituitary gland is unable to produce, aiming to restore normal hormonal balance and address the associated symptoms.;0.095;93.0;110.0;0.344;0.103;0.278;0.831;0.161;0.146;0.174

As a result of the mutation, these substances accumulate in the liver and blood, leading to the characteristic signs and symptoms of Dubin-Johnson syndrome, such as jaundice, dark urine, and elevated levels of bilirubin in the blood.;0.097;44.0;78.0;0.404;0.186;0.337;0.576;0.141;0.3;-0.012
902;gemini-pro;treatment;What are the treatments for X-linked hypophosphatemia ?;How might X-linked hypophosphatemia be treated? X-linked hypophosphatemia is different from other types of rickets because it cannot be treated by increasing vitamin D alone. Phosphate supplementation is generally required and is typically combined with a high dose of calcitriol, the activated form of vitamin D. Calcitriol increases calcium levels by promoting calcium absorption in the intestines, and calcium retention in kidneys. In children, treatment is usually initiated at the time of diagnosis and continues until bone growth is complete. The amount of phosphate and calcitriol are carefully monitored and adjusted to prevent the accumulation of calcium in the blood and kidneys, as these effects can harm the kidneys and other tissues.  Hyperparathyroidism, an endocrine disorder characterized by weakness and fatigue, can also occur as a result of treatment, and doses may be modified to manage this secondary complication. The main treatment goal for adults is to help improve pain. As such, treatment duration and dosage vary based on individual needs. Other treatment options may include administration of growth hormones to improve short-term growth in children. Corrective surgery may be necessary to fix leg curvatures for children whose diagnosis was delayed, or whose initial treatment was not adequate. Additionally, skull abnormalities may require treatment for synostosis (premature closing of sutures in the brain). Spontaneous abscesses in the mouth may require dental procedures periodically.  Recent clinical trials have investigated the potential of a new therapeutic antibody that inhibits fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a circulating hormone that causes phosphate wasting in the kidneys and is usually found in at high concentrations in people with XLH. These trials are ongoing, and more information can be found at clinicaltrials.gov.;"Treatment for X-linked hypophosphatemia typically involves addressing the underlying cause and managing the associated symptoms. This may include:

- Phosphate replacement therapy: Oral or intravenous phosphate supplements are administered to increase phosphate levels in the blood.

- Vitamin D supplements: Vitamin D is crucial for phosphate absorption. If the patient is deficient, vitamin D supplements are recommended.

- Active form of vitamin D analogs: Certain individuals with X-linked hypophosphatemia may benefit from calcitriol or other active forms of vitamin D to enhance phosphate absorption.

- Dietary modifications: A low-phosphate diet is often recommended to reduce urinary phosphate loss. However, this should be balanced against the need for adequate calcium and vitamin D intake.

- Alkaline phosphatase inhibitors: Medications like burosumab can help increase phosphate reabsorption in the kidneys and reduce urinary phosphate loss.

- Surgical intervention: In severe cases, orthopedic surgery may be necessary to correct bone deformities caused by rickets.";0.034;259.0;138.0;0.292;0.07;0.134;0.821;0.072;-0.005;0.148
903;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) malignant migrating partial seizures of infancy ?;"Malignant migrating partial seizures of infancy (MMPSI) is a severe form of epilepsy that begins very early in life. Recurrent seizures begin before the age of 6 months but commonly start within a few weeks of birth. The seizures do not respond well to treatment. Although affected individuals may develop normally at first, progression stalls and skills decline when seizures begin; as a result, affected individuals have profound developmental delay.  The seizures in MMPSI are described as partial (or focal) because the seizure activity occurs in regions of the brain rather than affecting the entire brain. Seizure activity can appear in multiple locations in the brain or move (migrate) from one region to another during an episode. Depending on the region affected, seizures can involve sudden redness and warmth (flushing) of the face; drooling; short pauses in breathing (apnea); movement of the head or eyes to one side; twitches in the eyelids or tongue; chewing motions; or jerking of an arm, leg, or both on one side of the body. If seizure activity spreads to affect the entire brain, it causes a loss of consciousness, muscle stiffening, and rhythmic jerking (tonic-clonic seizure). Episodes that begin as partial seizures and spread throughout the brain are known as secondarily generalized seizures.  Initially, the seizures associated with MMPSI are relatively infrequent, occurring every few weeks. Within a few months of the seizures starting, though, the frequency increases. Affected individuals can have clusters of five to 30 seizures several times a day. Each seizure typically lasts seconds to a couple of minutes, but they can be prolonged (classified as status epilepticus). In some cases, the seizure activity may be almost continuous for several days. After a year or more of persistent seizures, the episodes become less frequent.  Seizures can affect growth of the brain and lead to a small head size (microcephaly). The problems with brain development can also cause profound developmental delay and intellectual impairment. Affected babies often lose the mental and motor skills they developed after birth, such as the ability to make eye contact and control their head movement. Many have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and become ""floppy."" If seizures can be controlled for a short period, development may improve. Some affected children learn to reach for objects or walk. However, most children with this condition do not develop language skills.  Because of the serious health problems caused by MMPSI, many affected individuals do not survive past infancy or early childhood.";Malignant migrating partial seizures of infancy (MMPSI) is a rare and severe form of epilepsy that typically begins in the first few months of life. Infants with MMPSI experience frequent, prolonged seizures that can migrate from one brain hemisphere to the other. These seizures are often difficult to control with medication and can lead to severe neurological impairment and developmental delays. The exact cause of MMPSI is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treatment for MMPSI typically involves a combination of anti-seizure medications, dietary modifications, and surgical intervention. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for improving the prognosis of infants with MMPSI.;0.013;374.0;105.0;0.304;0.08;0.187;0.8;0.039;-0.134;0.222
904;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy ?;"Adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy (AVMD) is an eye disorder that can cause progressive vision loss. AVMD affects an area of the retina called the macula, which is responsible for sharp central vision. The condition causes a fatty yellow pigment to accumulate in cells underlying the macula, eventually damaging the cells. Signs and symptoms usually begin between ages 30 and 50 and include blurred and/or distorted vision, which can progress to central vision loss over time.Historically, AVMD has been characterized as a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the PRPH2, BEST1, IMPG1, and IMPG2 genes; however, recent studies focused on genetic testing suggest that there may be other unidentified genes and/or environmental causes.The majority of cases due to a mutation in the identified genes are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; however not all individuals have AVMD have a family history and not all individuals who inherit a causative gene mutation develop symptoms.";Adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy is a rare, inherited eye disorder that typically affects adults in their 30s or 40s. It is characterized by the development of yellow, egg yolk-like deposits (vitelliform lesions) in the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp central vision. These lesions can cause blurred vision, distorted vision, and difficulty seeing fine details. The condition is usually slowly progressive, with vision loss worsening over time. There is currently no cure for adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy, but treatments such as laser therapy or surgery may be used to slow the progression of the disease and preserve vision.;0.071;137.0;94.0;0.423;0.126;0.286;0.785;0.169;0.064;0.275

907;gemini-pro;exams and tests;How to diagnose Congenital Heart Defects ?;"Severe congenital heart defects generally are diagnosed during pregnancy or soon after birth. Less severe defects often aren't diagnosed until children are older.
                
Minor defects often have no signs or symptoms. Doctors may diagnose them based on results from a physical exam and tests done for another reason.
                
Specialists Involved
                
Pediatric cardiologists are doctors who specialize in the care of babies and children who have heart problems. Cardiac surgeons are specialists who repair heart defects using surgery.
                
Physical Exam
                
During a physical exam, the doctor will:
                
Listen to your child's heart and lungs with a stethoscope
                
Look for signs of a heart defect, such as cyanosis (a bluish tint to the skin, lips, or fingernails), shortness of breath, rapid breathing, delayed growth, or signs of heart failure
                
Diagnostic Tests
                
Echocardiography
                
Echocardiography (echo) is a painless test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the heart. During the test, the sound waves (called ultrasound) bounce off the structures of the heart. A computer converts the sound waves into pictures on a screen.
                
Echo allows the doctor to clearly see any problem with the way the heart is formed or the way it's working.
                
Echo is an important test for both diagnosing a heart problem and following the problem over time. The test can show problems with the heart's structure and how the heart is reacting to those problems. Echo will help your child's cardiologist decide if and when treatment is needed.
                
During pregnancy, if your doctor suspects that your baby has a congenital heart defect, fetal echo can be done. This test uses sound waves to create a picture of the baby's heart while the baby is still in the womb.
                
Fetal echo usually is done at about 18 to 22 weeks of pregnancy. If your child is diagnosed with a congenital heart defect before birth, your doctor can plan treatment before the baby is born.
                
EKG (Electrocardiogram)
                
An EKG is a simple, painless test that records the heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through the heart.
                
An EKG can detect if one of the heart's chambers is enlarged, which can help diagnose a heart problem.
                
Chest X Ray
                
A chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures in the chest, such as the heart and lungs. This test can show whether the heart is enlarged. It also can show whether the lungs have extra blood flow or extra fluid, a sign of heart failure.
                
Pulse Oximetry
                
For this test, a small sensor is attached to a finger or toe (like an adhesive bandage). The sensor gives an estimate of how much oxygen is in the blood.
                
Cardiac Catheterization
                
During cardiac catheterization (KATH-e-ter-ih-ZA-shun), a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a vein in the arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. The tube is threaded to the heart.
                
Special dye is injected through the catheter into a blood vessel or one of the hearts chambers. The dye allows the doctor to see blood flowing through the heart and blood vessels on an x-ray image.
                
The doctor also can use cardiac catheterization to measure the pressure and oxygen level inside the heart chambers and blood vessels. This can help the doctor figure out whether blood is mixing between the two sides of the heart.
                
Cardiac catheterization also is used to repair some heart defects.";"Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are structural abnormalities of the heart present at birth. Diagnosing CHDs involves a comprehensive approach that includes:

1. **Medical History and Physical Examination:** Detailed medical history, including family history of heart defects, symptoms like shortness of breath, cyanosis, murmurs, and abnormal heart sounds during physical examination, can provide initial clues.

2. **Echocardiography:** This is the primary imaging modality for CHD diagnosis. It uses ultrasound waves to produce detailed images of the heart, allowing visualization of heart chambers, valves, and blood flow patterns.

3. **Chest X-ray:** A chest X-ray can reveal abnormal heart size, shape, and lung changes suggestive of CHDs.

4. **Electrocardiogram (ECG):** An ECG records the heart's electrical activity, detecting abnormal heart rhythms or conduction defects associated with certain CHDs.

5. **Cardiac Catheterization:** Involves threading a thin tube into the heart to measure pressures, oxygen levels, and visualize heart structures. It is used for complex CHDs or when other tests are inconclusive.

6. **Fetal Echocardiography:** For suspected CHDs in utero, fetal echocardiography uses ultrasound to evaluate the fetal heart during pregnancy.

7. **Pulse Oximetry:** A non-invasive test measuring blood oxygen levels can detect cyanosis (low blood oxygen) seen in some CHDs.

8. **Genetic Testing:** Genetic testing may be recommended to identify genetic syndromes or specific gene mutations associated with CHDs.";0.011;509.0;204.0;0.323;0.063;0.151;0.754;-0.015;-0.072;0.041

At various times throughout the day, people with narcolepsy experience irresistable bouts ofsleep. If the urge becomes overwhelming, individuals will fall asleep for periods lasting from a few seconds to several minutes. In rare cases, some people may remain asleep for an hour or longer. In addition to excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), three other major symptoms frequently characterize narcolepsy: cataplexy, or the sudden loss of voluntary muscle tone; vivid hallucinations during sleep onset or upon awakening; and brief episodes of total paralysis at the beginning or end of sleep. Narcolepsy is not definitively diagnosed in most patients until 10 to 15 years after the first symptoms appear. The cause of narcolepsy remains unknown. It is likely that narcolepsy involves multiple factors interacting to cause neurological dysfunction and sleep disturbances.";Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that affects the brain's ability to control sleep-wake cycles, resulting in excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and frequent, uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep during the day. It is characterized by an inability to maintain wakefulness, often leading to sudden and irresistible sleep attacks that can occur at any time, even during activities such as eating, talking, or driving. Narcolepsy can also cause cataplexy, a sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by strong emotions like laughter, anger, or surprise, which can lead to temporary weakness or collapse.

Management generally focuses on the specific symptoms that are present in each individual and may require the coordination of various specialists. Psychiatric symptoms and chorea may be treated with certain antipsychotic medications known as dopamine-receptor blocking drugs. Other antipsychotic medications as well as antidepressants and/or sedatives may also be used to treat some affected individuals. Seizures may be treated with anti-convulsants, which may also help to treat psychiatric symptoms. Anti-seizure medications that can can worsen involuntary movements are generally avoided. Dystonia has been treated with botulinum toxin to relax the muscles and reduce spasms. Because of feeding difficulties in some cases, individuals may need to have their nutrition monitored. Nutritional support, supplementation and/or a feeding tube may be necessary in some cases. Additional therapies that may be used to treat affected individuals may include speech therapy, physical therapy and occupational therapy. Mechanical devices, such as braces or a wheelchair, may benefit some people. Computer-assisted speech devices may be necessary in some cases.

A genetics professionl can review your medical and family history in order to provide you with your specific risks. To learn more about genetic consultations, click here.;Yes, Hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis (HCHWA) is an inherited condition caused by mutations in the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) gene. The APP gene provides instructions for making a protein called amyloid precursor protein, which is found in nerve cells in the brain and other tissues. Mutations in the APP gene can lead to the production of abnormal forms of amyloid precursor protein that are prone to clumping together and forming amyloid plaques in the brain. These plaques can interfere with the normal function of nerve cells and lead to a variety of neurological problems, including recurrent strokes due to bleeding in the brain. HCHWA is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that a person needs only one copy of the mutated gene to be affected by the condition.;0.043;64.0;116.0;0.241;0.062;0.19;0.732;-0.116;-0.091;-0.145

912;gemini-pro;causes;What causes What I need to know about My Child's Urinary Tract Infection ?;"Most UTIs are caused by bacteria that live in the bowel, the part of the digestive tract where stool is changed from liquid to solid. The bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli) causes most UTIs. The urinary tract has several systems to prevent infection. The points where the ureters attach to the bladder act like one-way valves to prevent urine from backing up, or refluxing, toward the kidneys, and urination washes microbes out of the body. The bodys natural defenses also prevent infection. But despite these safeguards, infections still occur.
                
Other factors that may cause a child to get a UTI include the following:
                
- Waiting to urinate. Regular urination helps flush away bacteria. Holding urine allows bacteria to grow.  - Making too little urine. A child that doesnt drink enough fluids may not make enough urine to flush away bacteria.  - Constipation. Constipation is a condition in which a child has fewer than two bowel movements a week. Stools can be hard, dry, small, and difficult to pass. The hard stool in the bowel may press against the urinary tract and block the flow of urine, allowing bacteria to grow.
                
Some children are just more prone to UTIs than others, just as some children are more prone to getting coughs, colds, or ear infections.";Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children are often caused by bacteria entering the urethra and traveling up to the bladder. Common symptoms include frequent urination, urgency to urinate, pain or burning with urination, and cloudy or foul-smelling urine. UTIs can lead to more serious health problems if left untreated, so it's important to seek medical attention promptly if your child exhibits these symptoms. Treatment typically involves antibiotics, and preventive measures include good hygiene practices, drinking plenty of fluids, and avoiding irritants.;0.01;189.0;79.0;0.262;0.047;0.136;0.794;-0.023;-0.104;0.058

914;gemini-pro;susceptibility;Who is at risk for Parasites - Cysticercosis? ?;"Cysticercosis is an infection caused by the larvae of the tapeworm, Taenia solium. A person with an adult tapeworm, which lives in the person’s gut, sheds eggs in the stool.  The infection with the adult tapeworm is called taeniasis.  A pig then eats the eggs in the stool.  The eggs develop into larvae inside the pig and form cysts (called cysticerci) in the pig's muscles or other tissues. The infection with the cysts is called cysticercosis. Humans who eat undercooked or raw infected pork swallow the cysts in the meat. The larvae then come out of their cysts in the human gut and develop into adult tapeworms, completing the cycle.
    
People get cysticercosis when they swallow eggs that are excreted in the stool of people with the adult tapeworm. This may happen when people
    
     - Drink water or eat food contaminated with tapeworm eggs
     - Put contaminated fingers in their mouth
    
    
Cysticercosis is not spread by eating undercooked meat. However, people get infected with tapeworms (taeniasis) by eating undercooked infected pork. People who have tapeworm infections can infect themselves with the eggs and develop cysticercosis (this is called autoinfection). They can also infect other people if they have poor hygiene and contaminate food or water that other people swallow. People who live with someone who has a tapeworm infection in their intestines have a much higher risk of getting cysticercosis than other people.
    
Human cysticercosis is found worldwide, especially in areas where pig cysticercosis is common. Both taeniasis and cysticercosis are most often found in rural areas of developing countries with poor sanitation, where pigs roam freely and eat human feces. Taeniasis and cysticercosis are rare among persons who live in countries where pigs are not raised and in countries where pigs do not have contact with human feces. Although uncommon, cysticercosis can occur in people who have never traveled outside of the United States if they are exposed to tapeworm eggs.
    
More on: Taeniasis";Individuals most at risk for Cysticercosis are those who reside in areas where the parasite is prevalent, such as regions with poor sanitation and inadequate access to clean water. Additionally, individuals who consume undercooked or raw pork, or those who come into contact with contaminated soil or water, are also at an increased risk of infection. Those with weakened immune systems, such as individuals with HIV/AIDS or those taking immunosuppressive medications, are also more susceptible to severe Cysticercosis infection. Furthermore, individuals who work in close contact with pigs or pork products may also be at an elevated risk of acquiring the parasite.;0.007;295.0;98.0;0.304;0.058;0.168;0.673;-0.038;-0.152;0.078

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pituitary is then used to locate and detect the size of the tumor causing GH overproduction.  - The first line of treatment is usually surgical removal of the tumor. Medication or radiation may be used instead of or in addition to surgery.";Acromegaly, characterized by excessive growth hormone production, can be managed through various approaches. Medical management often involves medications like octreotide or pegvisomant to suppress hormone production or dopamine agonists like cabergoline to reduce growth hormone levels. Surgical intervention, particularly transsphenoidal surgery to remove a pituitary tumor causing the overproduction, is another option. Additionally, lifestyle modifications, including a balanced diet and regular exercise, are recommended to manage weight and mitigate complications associated with acromegaly. In severe cases, radiation therapy may be necessary to target residual tumor tissue or control hormone levels.;0.013;134.0;87.0;0.244;0.038;0.159;0.727;-0.018;0.002;-0.042

920;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to thiopurine S-methyltransferase deficiency ?;"TPMT deficiency results from changes in the TPMT gene. This gene provides instructions for making the TPMT enzyme, which plays a critical role in breaking down (metabolizing) thiopurine drugs. Once inside the body, these drugs are converted to toxic compounds that kill immune system cells in the bone marrow. The TPMT enzyme ""turns off"" thiopurine drugs by breaking them down into inactive, nontoxic compounds. Changes in the TPMT gene reduce the stability and activity of the TPMT enzyme. Without enough of this enzyme, the drugs cannot be ""turned off,"" so they stay in the body longer and continue to destroy cells unchecked. The resulting damage to the bone marrow leads to potentially life-threatening myelosuppression.";Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) deficiency is an inherited condition in which the body is unable to properly metabolize certain medications, including thiopurine drugs such as azathioprine and mercaptopurine. This deficiency is caused by genetic variations in the TPMT gene, which encodes the TPMT enzyme. Common genetic changes include single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), such as TPMT*2, TPMT*3A, and TPMT*3C, which result in decreased or absent TPMT enzyme activity. These genetic variations can lead to an increased risk of side effects from thiopurine drugs, such as bone marrow suppression and liver damage. Genetic testing for TPMT variants is recommended before starting thiopurine therapy to determine the appropriate dosage and minimize the risk of adverse reactions.;0.033;101.0;105.0;0.312;0.063;0.213;0.734;0.124;0.123;0.121

922;gemini-pro;information;Do you have information about Vitamin K;Summary : Vitamins are substances that your body needs to grow and develop normally. Vitamin K helps your body by making proteins for healthy bones and tissues. It also makes proteins for blood clotting. If you don't have enough vitamin K, you may bleed too much.    Newborns have very little vitamin K. They usually get a shot of vitamin K soon after they are born.    If you take blood thinners, you need to be careful about how much vitamin K you get. You also need to be careful about taking vitamin E supplements. Vitamin E can interfere with how vitamin K works in your body. Ask your health care provider for recommendations about these vitamins.    There are different types of vitamin K. Most people get vitamin K from plants such as green vegetables, and dark berries. Bacteria in your intestines also produce small amounts of another type of vitamin K.;Vitamin K, a fat-soluble vitamin, plays a crucial role in blood clotting, preventing excessive bleeding. It is found in leafy greens, like spinach and kale, as well as in some vegetable oils and meats. Vitamin K deficiency can lead to impaired blood clotting, increasing the risk of excessive bleeding. This is especially important for individuals taking blood thinners or undergoing surgery. Maintaining adequate levels of vitamin K through diet or supplementation is essential for optimal blood clotting and overall well-being.;0.016;148.0;77.0;0.194;0.041;0.097;0.67;0.106;0.09;0.118
923;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to tarsal-carpal coalition syndrome ?;Tarsal-carpal coalition syndrome is caused by mutations in the NOG gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called noggin. This protein plays an important role in proper bone and joint development by blocking (inhibiting) signals that stimulate bone formation. The noggin protein attaches (binds) to proteins called bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which keeps the BMPs from triggering signals for the development of bone.  NOG gene mutations that cause tarsal-carpal coalition syndrome reduce the amount of functional noggin protein. With decreased noggin function, BMPs abnormally stimulate bone formation in joint areas, where there should be no bone, causing the bone fusions seen in people with tarsal-carpal coalition syndrome.  Mutations in the NOG gene are involved in several disorders with overlapping signs and symptoms. Because of a shared genetic cause and overlapping features, researchers have suggested that these conditions, including tarsal-carpal coalition syndrome, represent a spectrum of related conditions referred to as NOG-related-symphalangism spectrum disorder (NOG-SSD).;Tarsal-carpal coalition syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the abnormal fusion of bones in the wrist and ankle joints. The exact genetic cause of the syndrome is unknown, but studies have identified several genetic changes associated with the condition. These genetic changes involve mutations in genes that play a role in embryonic development, particularly in the formation of the limbs. Specifically, mutations in genes such as HOXD13, PITX1, and GDF5 have been linked to tarsal-carpal coalition syndrome. These mutations disrupt the normal signaling pathways involved in limb development, leading to the abnormal fusion of bones in the wrist and ankle joints. Further research is ongoing to fully elucidate the genetic basis of tarsal-carpal coalition syndrome and to develop potential therapeutic strategies.;0.046;144.0;110.0;0.299;0.063;0.182;0.753;0.147;0.079;0.215

Medical and Family History
                
Taking a medical and family history may help a health care provider diagnose kidney disease.
                
Physical Exam
                
A physical exam may help diagnose kidney disease. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually
                
- measures the patients blood pressure  - examines the patients body for swelling
                
Urine Tests
                
Dipstick test for albumin and blood. A dipstick test performed on a urine sample can detect the presence of albumin and blood. The patient provides a urine sample in a special container in a health care providers office or a commercial facility. A nurse or technician can test the sample in the same location, or he or she can send it to a lab for analysis. The test involves placing a strip of chemically treated paper, called a dipstick, into the patients urine sample. Patches on the dipstick change color when albumin or blood is present in urine.
                
Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. A health care provider uses this measurement, which compares the amount of albumin with the amount of creatinine in a urine sample, to estimate 24-hour albumin excretion. A patient may have chronic kidney disease if the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio is greater than 30 milligrams (mg) of albumin for each gram (g) of creatinine (30 mg/g). This measurement is also called UACR.
                
Blood Test
                
A blood test involves having blood drawn at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. A health care provider may order a blood test to estimate how much blood a patients kidneys filter each minutea measurement called the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Depending on the results, the test can indicate the following:
                
- eGFR of 60 or above is in the normal range  - eGFR below 60 may indicate kidney disease  - eGFR of 15 or below may indicate kidney failure";"IgA nephropathy is typically diagnosed through a combination of tests, including:
- Urinalysis: This test analyzes a sample of urine for the presence of red blood cells, protein, white blood cells, and casts (cylinders of protein and cellular material).
- Blood tests: These tests measure serum creatinine and IgA levels, as well as assess kidney function and rule out other conditions.
- Kidney biopsy: This procedure involves taking a small sample of kidney tissue for examination under a microscope. It is the definitive test for diagnosing IgA nephropathy and can help determine the extent of kidney damage.";0.002;279.0;87.0;0.195;0.013;0.13;0.502;-0.102;-0.211;0.008

The features of the disorder vary among affected individuals.  People with Cant syndrome have thick scalp hair that extends onto the forehead and grows down onto the cheeks in front of the ears. They also have increased body hair, especially on the back, arms, and legs. Most affected individuals have a large head (macrocephaly) and distinctive facial features that are described as ""coarse."" These include a broad nasal bridge, skin folds covering the inner corner of the eyes (epicanthal folds), and a wide mouth with full lips. As affected individuals get older, the face lengthens, the chin becomes more prominent, and the eyes become deep-set.  Many infants with Cant syndrome are born with a heart defect such as an enlarged heart (cardiomegaly) or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The ductus arteriosus is a connection between two major arteries, the aorta and the pulmonary artery. This connection is open during fetal development and normally closes shortly after birth. However, the ductus arteriosus remains open, or patent, in babies with PDA. Other heart problems have also been found in people with Cant syndrome, including an abnormal buildup of fluid around the heart (pericardial effusion) and high blood pressure in the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the lungs (pulmonary hypertension).  Additional features of this condition include distinctive skeletal abnormalities, a large body size (macrosomia) at birth, a reduced amount of fat under the skin (subcutaneous fat) beginning in childhood, deep horizontal creases in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, and an increased susceptibility to respiratory infections. Other signs and symptoms that have been reported include abnormal swelling in the body's tissues (lymphedema), side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis), and reduced bone density (osteopenia).

926;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets ?;Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets is a disorder related to low levels of phosphate in the blood (hypophosphatemia). Phosphate is a mineral that is essential for the normal formation of bones and teeth.  In most cases, the signs and symptoms of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets begin in early childhood. The features of the disorder vary widely, even among affected members of the same family. Mildly affected individuals may have hypophosphatemia without other signs and symptoms. More severely affected children experience slow growth and are shorter than their peers. They develop bone abnormalities that can interfere with movement and cause bone pain. The most noticeable of these abnormalities are bowed legs or knock knees (a condition in which the lower legs are positioned at an outward angle). These abnormalities become apparent with weight-bearing activities such as walking. If untreated, they tend to worsen with time.  Other signs and symptoms of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can include premature fusion of the skull bones (craniosynostosis) and dental abnormalities. The disorder may also cause abnormal bone growth where ligaments and tendons attach to joints (enthesopathy). In adults, hypophosphatemia is characterized by a softening of the bones known as osteomalacia.  Researchers have described several forms of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets, which are distinguished by their pattern of inheritance and genetic cause. The most common form of the disorder is known as X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH). It has an X-linked dominant pattern of inheritance. X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, and autosomal recessive forms of the disorder are much rarer. The different inheritance patterns are described below.  Another rare type of the disorder is known as hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH). In addition to hypophosphatemia, this condition is characterized by the excretion of high levels of calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria).;Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets (HHR) is a rare inherited disorder that affects the way the body absorbs and uses phosphorus, leading to soft and weakened bones (rickets) and other health problems. It is caused by mutations in genes involved in the regulation of phosphate homeostasis, such as SLC34A3, PHEX, CLCN5, and DENT1, resulting in impaired phosphate reabsorption in the proximal tubule of the kidneys and excessive urinary phosphate loss. This leads to low levels of phosphate in the blood (hypophosphatemia), which disrupts normal bone mineralization and growth. HHR can manifest in various forms, including vitamin D-dependent rickets, X-linked hypophosphatemia, and autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets, each with distinct genetic and clinical features.;0.026;265.0;103.0;0.314;0.072;0.152;0.863;0.041;-0.027;0.108

Everyone has dry mouth once in a while -- if they are nervous, upset, under stress, or taking certain medications. But if you have dry mouth all or most of the time, see a dentist or physician. Many older adults have dry mouth, but it is not a normal part of aging. (Watch the video to learn more about dry mouth. To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. To reduce the video, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.) Why Saliva is Important Saliva does more than keep your mouth wet. It protects teeth from decay, helps heal sores in your mouth, and prevents infection by controlling bacteria, viruses, and fungi in the mouth. Saliva helps digest food and helps us chew and swallow. Saliva is involved in taste perception as well. Each of these functions of saliva is hampered when a person has dry mouth. How Dry Mouth Feels Dry mouth can be uncomfortable. Some people notice a sticky, dry feeling in the mouth. Others notice a burning feeling or difficulty while eating. The throat may feel dry, too, making swallowing difficult and choking common. Also, people with dry mouth may get mouth sores, cracked lips, and a dry, rough tongue.;Dry mouth, also known as xerostomia, is a condition in which the salivary glands in the mouth do not produce enough saliva to keep the mouth moist. Saliva helps to break down food, clean the mouth, and protect the teeth from decay. When the mouth is dry, it can cause a number of problems, including difficulty speaking, swallowing, and chewing, as well as an increased risk of cavities and gum disease. Dry mouth can be caused by a number of factors, including certain medications, medical conditions, and lifestyle choices.;0.018;202.0;79.0;0.301;0.092;0.151;0.684;0.046;-0.023;0.113

AIP is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, which means only one of the two HMBS genes needs to have a disease-causing mutation to decrease enzyme activity and cause symptoms.;Yes, Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is an inherited metabolic disorder caused by a genetic defect in the heme biosynthesis pathway. The AIP gene, located on chromosome 11, provides instructions for producing an enzyme called porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD). Mutations in the AIP gene result in a deficiency or malfunction of PBGD, leading to a buildup of toxic intermediates in the heme biosynthesis pathway, particularly porphobilinogen (PBG) and aminolevulinic acid (ALA). Inheritance of AIP follows an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that only one copy of the defective gene is sufficient to cause the disorder. However, the penetrance of AIP is incomplete, meaning that not all individuals who inherit the AIP gene will manifest symptoms.;0.047;34.0;98.0;0.333;0.115;0.294;0.859;0.141;0.305;-0.016

This leads to a build-up of phenylalanine in the blood and can cause severe intellectual disability, seizures, behavioral problems, and other health issues if left untreated. Treatment involves following a strict diet low in phenylalanine and regular monitoring of phenylalanine levels in the blood. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent complications and ensure optimal outcomes.;0.021;149.0;70.0;0.268;0.047;0.191;0.815;0.121;-0.025;0.272
935;gemini-pro;symptoms;What are the symptoms of Pars planitis ?;"What are the signs and symptoms of pars planitis? Pars planitis is characterized by inflammation of the narrowed area (pars plana) between the colored part of the eye (iris) and the choroid. This may lead to blurred vision; dark, floating spots in the vision; and progressive vision loss. Approximately 80% of cases are bilateral (affecting both eyes), although one eye is typically more affected than the other. As the condition advances, cataracts, retinal detachment, or macular edema (fluid within the retina) may develop.";Pars planitis is an inflammatory condition affecting the pars plana, the middle layer of the eye. Symptoms typically include floaters, which are small specks or strings that appear to float in the field of vision, as well as blurred vision, flashes of light, and pain in the eye. Other symptoms may include redness of the eye, sensitivity to light, and difficulty seeing in dim light. In some cases, pars planitis can also lead to retinal detachment, a serious condition in which the retina separates from the back of the eye.;0.044;74.0;79.0;0.439;0.096;0.228;0.894;0.163;0.126;0.198
936;gemini-pro;information;Do you have information about Seniors' Health;Summary : People in the U.S. are living longer than ever before. Many seniors live active and healthy lives. But there's no getting around one thing: as we age, our bodies and minds change. There are things you can do to stay healthy and active as you age.It is important to understand what to expect. Some changes may just be part of normal aging, while others may be a warning sign of a medical problem. It is important to know the difference, and to let your healthcare provider know if you have any concerns.    Having a healthy lifestyle can help you to deal with normal aging changes and make the most of your life.;Seniors' health is a vital aspect of overall well-being, and it encompasses various physical, mental, and social aspects. As we age, our bodies undergo several changes, and it becomes essential to prioritize health maintenance and prevention. Common health concerns among seniors include chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis, as well as age-related conditions like dementia and osteoporosis. Regular check-ups, healthy lifestyle choices, and proper nutrition play a crucial role in preserving seniors' health. Additionally, social engagement, cognitive stimulation, and emotional well-being are key factors in promoting healthy aging. By understanding these health aspects and implementing appropriate interventions, we can help seniors enjoy a higher quality of life and independence for longer.;0.054;107.0;111.0;0.272;0.066;0.198;0.766;0.052;0.075;0.026
937;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Cornelia de Lange syndrome ?;Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a developmental disorder that affects many parts of the body. The severity of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms can vary widely, but may include distinctive facial characteristics, growth delays, intellectual disability and limb defects. Approximately 65% of people affected by CdLS have a change (mutation) in the NIPBL gene. Another 5% of cases are caused by mutations in one of four known genes: SMC1A, SMC3, HDAC8 and RAD21. In the remaining 30% of cases, the underlying genetic cause of the condition is unknown. CdLS can be inherited in an autosomal dominant (NIPBL, SMC2, or RAD21) or X-linked (SMC1A or HDAC8) manner. However, most cases result from new (de novo) mutations and occur in people with no family history of the condition. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.;Cornelia de Lange syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects multiple parts of the body. It is caused by mutations in genes involved in cell division and development. Symptoms can include intellectual disability, delayed growth, distinctive facial features, small hands and feet, abnormalities of the arms and legs, heart defects, and gastrointestinal problems.

939;gemini-pro;treatment;What are the treatments for Marfan Syndrome ?;"Marfan syndrome has no cure. However, treatments can help delay or prevent complications, especially when started early.
                
Marfan syndrome can affect many parts of your body, including your heart, bones and joints, eyes, nervous system, and lungs. The type of treatment you receive will depend on your signs and symptoms.
                
Heart Treatments
                
Aortic dilation, or aortic aneurysm, is the most common and serious heart problem linked to Marfan syndrome. In this condition, the aortathe main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood to your bodystretches and grows weak.
                
Medicines are used to try to slow the rate of aortic dilation. Surgery is used to replace the dilated segment of aorta before it tears.
                
If you have Marfan syndrome, you'll need routine care and tests to check your heart valves and aorta.
                
Medicines
                
Beta blockers are medicines that help your heart beat slower and with less force. These medicines may help relieve strain on your aorta and slow the rate of aortic dilation.
                
Some people have side effects from beta blockers, such as tiredness and nausea (feeling sick to your stomach). If side effects occur, your doctor may prescribe a calcium channel blocker or ACE inhibitor instead of a beta blocker. Both medicines help relieve stress on the aorta.
                
Studies suggest that blocking a protein called TGF-beta may help prevent some of the effects of Marfan syndrome. Research shows that the medicine losartan may block the protein in other conditions.
                
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute currently is sponsoring a study comparing losartan to a beta blocker in children and adults who have Marfan syndrome. The study's goal is to find out which medicine, if either, is best at slowing the rate of aortic dilation.
                
Surgery
                
If your aorta stretches, it's more likely to tear (a condition called aortic dissection). To prevent this, your doctor may recommend surgery to repair or replace part of your aorta.
                
Surgery may involve:
                
A composite valve graft. For this surgery, part of the aorta and the aortic valve are removed. The aorta is replaced with a man-made tube called a graft. A man-made valve replaces the original valve.
                
Aortic valve-sparing surgery. If your aortic valve is working well, your doctor may recommend valve-sparing surgery. For this surgery, your doctor replaces the enlarged part of your aorta with a graft. Your aortic valve is left in place.
                
After aortic surgery, you may need medicines or followup tests. For example, after a composite valve graft, your doctor will prescribe medicines called anticoagulants, or ""blood thinners.""
                
Blood thinners help prevent blood clots from forming on your man-made aortic valve. You'll need to take these medicines for the rest of your life. If you've had valve-sparing surgery, you'll only need to take blood thinners for a short time, as your doctor prescribes.
                
If you've had a composite valve graft, you're at increased risk for endocarditis (EN-do-kar-DI-tis). This is an infection of the inner lining of your heart chambers and valves. Your doctor may recommend that you take antibiotics before certain medical or dental procedures that increase your risk of endocarditis.
                
Your doctor also may advise you to continue taking beta blockers or other medicines after either type of aortic surgery.
                
After surgery, you may have routine cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or cardiac computed tomography (CT) scans to check your aorta.
                
Cardiac MRI is a painless test that uses radio waves and magnets to created detailed pictures of your organs and tissues. Cardiac CT is a painless test that uses an x-ray machine to take clear, detailed pictures of your heart.
                
Bone and Joint Treatments
                
If you have scoliosis (a curved spine), your doctor may suggest a brace or other device to prevent the condition from getting worse. Severe cases of scoliosis may require surgery.
                
Some people who have Marfan syndrome need surgery to repair a chest that sinks in or sticks out. This surgery is done to prevent the chest from pressing on the lungs and heart.
                
Eye Treatments
                
Marfan syndrome can lead to many eye problems, such as a dislocated lens, nearsightedness, early glaucoma (high pressure in the fluid in the eyes), and cataracts (clouding of an eye's lens).
                
Glasses or contact lenses can help with some of these problems. Sometimes surgery is needed.
                
Nervous System Treatments
                
Marfan syndrome can lead to dural ectasia. In this condition, a substance called the dura (which covers the fluid around your brain and spinal cord) stretches and grows weak. This can cause the bones of the spine to wear away. Dural ectasia usually is treated with pain medicines.
                
Lung Treatments
                
Marfan syndrome may cause pneumothorax, or collapsed lung. In this condition, air or gas builds up in the space between the lungs and the chest wall.
                
If the condition is minor, it may go away on its own. However, you may need to have a tube placed through your skin and chest wall to remove the air. Sometimes surgery is needed.";Treatment for Marfan syndrome is focused on managing the specific manifestations of the disorder. Medications such as beta-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be prescribed to reduce strain on the heart and prevent aortic dissection. Surgery may be necessary to repair or replace the aortic valve or ascending aorta if they become enlarged or weakened. Regular monitoring and follow-up with a cardiologist and other specialists is essential to ensure early detection and treatment of any complications. Genetic counseling can be beneficial for individuals with Marfan syndrome and their families to understand the inheritance pattern and recurrence risks. Lifestyle modifications, such as avoiding strenuous physical activity and maintaining a healthy diet, are also important in managing the condition.;0.0;761.0;110.0;0.187;0.025;0.145;0.771;-0.072;-0.175;0.033

941;gemini-pro;causes;What causes Systemic scleroderma ?;"What causes systemic scleroderma? The exact, underlying cause of systemic sclerosis is unknown. The cause appears to involve some injury to the cells that line blood vessels, resulting in excessive activation of dermal connective tissue cells, called fibroblasts. Fibroblasts normally produce collagen and other proteins. Build-up of collagen in the skin and other organs causes the signs and symptoms of the condition. It is suspected that scleroderma may develop from a variety of factors, which may include: Abnormal immune or inflammatory activity Genetic susceptibility: while no specific genes are thought to cause scleroderma, certain genes (or combination of genes) may increase a person's risk to be affected. However, the condition is not passed directly from parents to children. Environmental triggers: suspected triggers may include infections; injury; drugs (e.g. vitamin K, cocaine, penicillamine, appetite suppressants and some chemotherapeutic agents); and chemicals (e.g. silica, organic solvents, pesticides, aliphatic hydrocarbons and epoxy resin). Hormones: because women develop scleroderma more often than men, researchers suspect that hormones may play a role. However, the role of female hormones has not been proven. Widespread scleroderma can also occur in association with other autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and polymyositis.";Systemic scleroderma, also known as systemic sclerosis, is an autoimmune disease that causes the overproduction of collagen in the body. This results in the hardening and thickening of the skin, as well as the involvement of internal organs such as the lungs, heart, kidneys, and digestive system. The exact cause of systemic scleroderma is unknown, but genetic, environmental, and immune system factors are believed to play a role. Certain genetic variations, hormonal factors, and exposure to certain toxins or infections may contribute to the development of the disease. Additionally, abnormalities in the immune system lead to the production of autoantibodies, which mistakenly attack the body's own tissues, causing inflammation and fibrosis.;0.022;183.0;97.0;0.308;0.066;0.174;0.784;0.058;-0.054;0.171

The inheritance pattern of CGL can vary depending on the specific genetic cause. In some cases, CGL is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that only one copy of the mutated gene is needed to cause the condition. In other cases, CGL is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning that two copies of the mutated gene are needed for the condition to manifest. Additionally, some cases of CGL may be caused by de novo mutations, which are spontaneous genetic changes that occur for the first time in an individual and are not inherited from either parent.;0.082;44.0;106.0;0.35;0.133;0.175;0.542;0.112;0.265;-0.034
943;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) IRAK-4 deficiency ?;IRAK-4 deficiency is an inherited disorder of the immune system (primary immunodeficiency). This immunodeficiency leads to recurrent infections by a subset of bacteria known as pyogenic bacteria but not by other infectious agents. (Infection with pyogenic bacteria causes the production of pus.) The most common infections in IRAK-4 deficiency are caused by the Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria. Most people with this condition have their first bacterial infection before age 2, and the infections can be life-threatening in infancy and childhood. Infections become less frequent with age.  Most people with IRAK-4 deficiency have invasive bacterial infections, which can involve the blood (septicemia), the membrane covering the brain and spinal cord (meningitis), or the joints (leading to inflammation and arthritis). Invasive infections can also cause areas of tissue breakdown and pus production (abscesses) on internal organs. In addition, affected individuals can have localized infections of the upper respiratory tract, skin, or eyes. Although fever is a common reaction to bacterial infections, many people with IRAK-4 deficiency do not at first develop a high fever in response to these infections, even if the infection is severe.;IRAK-4 deficiency is a rare genetic disorder characterized by an impaired immune response, leading to increased susceptibility to bacterial and viral infections. It is caused by mutations in the IRAK-4 gene, which encodes a protein crucial for signaling pathways involved in the activation of innate immune responses. Individuals with IRAK-4 deficiency often experience recurrent and severe infections, particularly those caused by encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. They may also exhibit impaired responses to certain vaccines and an increased risk of developing autoimmune disorders.;0.018;172.0;81.0;0.296;0.067;0.178;0.805;0.107;0.017;0.198

- Drinking plenty of water and other liquids can help flush bacteria from the urinary tract and dilute urine so kidney stones cannot form. A person should drink enough liquid to produce about 2 to 2.5 quarts of urine every day.3  - Reducing sodium intake, mostly from salt, may help prevent kidney stones. Diets high in sodium can increase the excretion of calcium into the urine and thus increase the chance of calciumcontaining kidney stones forming.  - Foods rich in animal proteins such as meat, eggs, and fish can increase the chance of uric acid stones and calcium stones forming. People who form stones should limit their meat consumption to 6 to 8 ounces a day.4  - People who are more likely to develop calcium oxalate stones should include 1,000 milligrams of calcium in their diet every day. Adults older than 50 years should consume 1,200 milligrams of calcium daily.3 Calcium in the digestive tract binds to oxalate from food and keeps it from entering the blood and the urinary tract, where it can form stones.
                
People with medullary sponge kidney should talk with their health care provider or a dietitian before making any dietary changes. A dietitian can help a person plan healthy meals.";Medullary Sponge Kidney (MSK) is a rare condition characterized by abnormal development of the collecting ducts in the kidney. Treatment for MSK depends on the severity of the condition. For mild cases, no treatment may be necessary. For more severe cases, treatment options may include medication to manage pain and prevent infection, surgery to remove affected portions of the kidney, or lithotripsy to break up kidney stones. In some cases, a combination of treatments may be necessary.

946;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Stroke ?;"Two major types of heart and blood vessel disease, also called cardiovascular disease, are common in people with diabetes: coronary artery disease (CAD) and cerebral vascular disease. People with diabetes are also at risk for heart failure. Narrowing or blockage of the blood vessels in the legs, a condition called peripheral arterial disease, can also occur in people with diabetes.
                
Coronary Artery Disease
                
Coronary artery disease, also called ischemic heart disease, is caused by a hardening or thickening of the walls of the blood vessels that go to your heart. Your blood supplies oxygen and other materials your heart needs for normal functioning. If the blood vessels to your heart become narrowed or blocked by fatty deposits, the blood supply is reduced or cut off, resulting in a heart attack.
                
Cerebral Vascular Disease
                
Cerebral vascular disease affects blood flow to the brain, leading to strokes and TIAs. It is caused by narrowing, blocking, or hardening of the blood vessels that go to the brain or by high blood pressure.
                
Stroke
                
A stroke results when the blood supply to the brain is suddenly cut off, which can occur when a blood vessel in the brain or neck is blocked or bursts. Brain cells are then deprived of oxygen and die. A stroke can result in problems with speech or vision or can cause weakness or paralysis. Most strokes are caused by fatty deposits or blood clotsjelly-like clumps of blood cellsthat narrow or block one of the blood vessels in the brain or neck. A blood clot may stay where it formed or can travel within the body. People with diabetes are at increased risk for strokes caused by blood clots.
                
A stroke may also be caused by a bleeding blood vessel in the brain. Called an aneurysm, a break in a blood vessel can occur as a result of high blood pressure or a weak spot in a blood vessel wall.
                
TIAs
                
TIAs are caused by a temporary blockage of a blood vessel to the brain. This blockage leads to a brief, sudden change in brain function, such as temporary numbness or weakness on one side of the body. Sudden changes in brain function also can lead to loss of balance, confusion, blindness in one or both eyes, double vision, difficulty speaking, or a severe headache. However, most symptoms disappear quickly and permanent damage is unlikely. If symptoms do not resolve in a few minutes, rather than a TIA, the event could be a stroke. The occurrence of a TIA means that a person is at risk for a stroke sometime in the future. See page 3 for more information on risk factors for stroke.
                
Heart Failure
                
Heart failure is a chronic condition in which the heart cannot pump blood properlyit does not mean that the heart suddenly stops working. Heart failure develops over a period of years, and symptoms can get worse over time. People with diabetes have at least twice the risk of heart failure as other people. One type of heart failure is congestive heart failure, in which fluid builds up inside body tissues. If the buildup is in the lungs, breathing becomes difficult.
                
Blockage of the blood vessels and high blood glucose levels also can damage heart muscle and cause irregular heart beats. People with damage to heart muscle, a condition called cardiomyopathy, may have no symptoms in the early stages, but later they may experience weakness, shortness of breath, a severe cough, fatigue, and swelling of the legs and feet. Diabetes can also interfere with pain signals normally carried by the nerves, explaining why a person with diabetes may not experience the typical warning signs of a heart attack.
                
Peripheral Arterial Disease
                
Another condition related to heart disease and common in people with diabetes is peripheral arterial disease (PAD). With this condition, the blood vessels in the legs are narrowed or blocked by fatty deposits, decreasing blood flow to the legs and feet. PAD increases the chances of a heart attack or stroke occurring. Poor circulation in the legs and feet also raises the risk of amputation. Sometimes people with PAD develop pain in the calf or other parts of the leg when walking, which is relieved by resting for a few minutes.";Diabetes, heart disease, and stroke are all serious medical conditions that can have a significant impact on your health and well-being. Diabetes is a chronic condition in which the body cannot properly produce or use insulin, leading to high blood sugar levels. Heart disease encompasses a range of conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, including coronary artery disease, heart attack, and heart failure. Stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain is interrupted, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients. These conditions share common risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, and physical inactivity. Managing these risk factors and making healthy lifestyle choices can help reduce your chances of developing or experiencing complications from diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.;0.002;635.0;118.0;0.248;0.088;0.145;0.676;-0.043;-0.181;0.099

Liver function tests are blood tests that check to see how well your liver is working. They check for liver damage, and can help diagnose liver diseases such as hepatitis and cirrhosis. You may have liver function tests as part of a regular checkup. Or you may have them if you have symptoms of liver disease. Doctors also use the tests to monitor some liver diseases, treatments, and possible side effects of medicines.    Liver function tests measure certain proteins, enzymes, and substances, including:       - Albumin, a protein that the liver makes    - Total protein (TP)    - Enzymes that are found in the liver, including alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT)    - Bilirubin, a yellow substance that is part of bile. It is formed when your red blood cells break down. Too much bilirubin in the blood can cause jaundice. There is also a urine test for bilirubin.    - Prothrombin time, which measures how long it takes for your blood to clot. Prothrombin is made by the liver.;Liver function tests (LFTs) are a panel of blood tests used to assess the health of the liver. LFTs can detect liver damage, inflammation, or dysfunction. Common LFTs include alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin, albumin, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). Elevated levels of ALT, AST, and ALP can indicate liver cell damage or inflammation. High bilirubin levels may suggest cholestasis or liver disease. Low albumin levels can indicate decreased protein synthesis by the liver. Elevated GGT levels may indicate cholestasis or alcohol abuse. LFTs are commonly used to diagnose and monitor liver diseases such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and fatty liver disease. They can also help evaluate the effectiveness of liver medications and detect drug-induced liver injury.;0.06;173.0;115.0;0.411;0.119;0.24;0.685;0.121;0.08;0.159
948;gemini-pro;information;Do you have information about Prenatal Testing;Summary : Prenatal testing provides information about your baby's health before he or she is born. Some routine tests during pregnancy also check on your health. At your first prenatal visit, your healthcare provider will test for a number of things, including problems with your blood, signs of infections, and whether you are immune to rubella (German measles) and chickenpox.    Throughout your pregnancy, your healthcare provider may suggest a number of other tests, too. Some tests are suggested for all women, such as screenings for gestational diabetes, Down syndrome, and HIV. Other tests might be offered based on your:       - Age    - Personal or family health history    - Ethnic background    - Results of routine tests       Some tests are screening tests. They detect risks for or signs of possible health problems in you or your baby. Based on screening test results, your doctor might suggest diagnostic tests. Diagnostic tests confirm or rule out health problems in you or your baby.     Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health;Prenatal testing encompasses a range of procedures performed during pregnancy to assess the health and well-being of the developing fetus. It includes screening tests, such as blood tests, urine analysis, and ultrasound scans, which are routinely offered to all pregnant women to identify potential risks and abnormalities. Diagnostic tests, like amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS), are more invasive and are typically recommended when screening tests indicate a higher chance of a genetic disorder or birth defect. Prenatal testing plays a crucial role in providing valuable information to expecting parents, allowing them to make informed decisions regarding their pregnancy and prepare for the birth of their child.;0.013;162.0;100.0;0.269;0.05;0.164;0.762;0.03;-0.014;0.072
949;gemini-pro;exams and tests;How to diagnose Parasites - Baylisascaris infection ?;"If you suspect you have been infected, consult your health care provider immediately. Be sure to tell your health care provider if you have recently been exposed to raccoons or their feces.
    
Diagnosis is difficult because symptoms depend on the number of infecting larvae and location in the body. Ocular larva migrans, when the larvae migrate to the eye, can cause sensitivity to light, inflammation of the eye, and blindness. Symptoms of visceral larva migrans, when the larvae travel to organs, depend on which organs are affected. For example, an invasion of the liver may cause hepatomegaly (inflammation and enlargement of the liver), while an invasion of the lung may cause pulmonary symptoms such as cough or chest pain. Larvae rarely end up in the nervous system but the most severe cases are neural larva migrans, when the larvae migrate into the brain and cause it to swell (encephalitis). There is no commercially available test for Baylisascaris infection. A health care provider may test blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and tissue to determine if an individual is infected. Eye examinations may reveal a migrating larva or lesions and are often the most significant clue to infection with Baylisascaris.
    
Diagnosis often is made by ruling out other infections that cause similar symptoms. Information on diagnosis and testing can be obtained through your local or state health department or CDC.
    
More on: Resources for Health Professionals: Diagnosis";"Diagnosis of Baylisascaris infection involves several steps:

1. **Clinical Presentation:** Initially, consider the patient's clinical presentation, such as abdominal pain, gastrointestinal disturbances, respiratory symptoms, or neurological manifestations, which may vary depending on the severity and location of the infection.

2. **Laboratory Tests:** Perform laboratory tests to detect the presence of Baylisascaris parasites or their components:
   - **Microscopic Examination:** Examine stool, respiratory secretions, or cerebrospinal fluid for the presence of Baylisascaris eggs or larvae using microscopy techniques.
   - **Serological Tests:** Conduct serological tests, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or Western blot, to detect antibodies produced in response to Baylisascaris infection.

3. **Imaging Studies:** Utilize imaging techniques like computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess visceral larva migrans (VLM) lesions in various organs and evaluate the extent of infection.

4. **Biopsy:** In certain cases, a biopsy of affected tissues, such as lung or liver, may be performed to directly identify Baylisascaris larvae or granulomas associated with the infection.

5. **Molecular Techniques:** Employ molecular diagnostic techniques like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify and identify Baylisascaris DNA in clinical specimens.";0.017;215.0;171.0;0.267;0.045;0.133;0.743;-0.035;-0.05;-0.022

3. **Pain Relief:** Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can help alleviate pain and fever associated with pyelonephritis.

4. **Hydration:** Maintain adequate fluid intake to promote urine flow and help flush out bacteria from the urinary tract.

5. **Rest:** Allow your body time to heal by getting plenty of rest. Avoid strenuous activities that may worsen your condition.

6. **Monitor Symptoms:** Keep track of your symptoms and notify your doctor if they worsen or if new symptoms arise.

7. **Follow-Up Care:** After completing treatment, your doctor may recommend follow-up tests to ensure the infection has cleared and to assess any potential complications.";0.003;16.0;153.0;0.065;0.0;0.065;0.404;-0.161;0.033;-0.344
951;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Foot Drop ?;"Foot drop describes the inability to raise the front part of the foot due to weakness or paralysis of the muscles that lift the foot. As a result, individuals with foot drop scuff their toes along the ground or bend their knees to lift their foot higher than usual to avoid the scuffing, which causes what is called a steppage gait. Foot drop can be unilateral (affecting one foot) or bilateral (affecting both feet). Foot drop is a symptom of an underlying problem and is either temporary or permanent, depending on the cause. Causes include: neurodegenerative disorders of the brain that cause muscular problems, such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, and cerebral palsy; motor neuron disorders such as polio, some forms of spinal muscular atrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (commonly known as Lou Gehrigs disease); injury to the nerve roots, such as in spinal stenosis; peripheral nerve disorders such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease or acquired peripheral neuropathy; local compression or damage to the peroneal nerve as it passes across the fibular bone below the knee; and muscle disorders, such as muscular dystrophy or myositis.";Foot drop is a condition in which the foot hangs down and cannot be lifted due to weakness or paralysis of the muscles that control the movement of the foot and ankle. It can be caused by various neurological conditions such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, or peripheral neuropathy, as well as muscular disorders and injuries to the nerves or muscles that control foot movement. Foot drop can cause difficulty walking, tripping, and maintaining balance.

952;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to neurofibromatosis type 1 ?;Mutations in the NF1 gene cause neurofibromatosis type 1.  The NF1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called neurofibromin. This protein is produced in many cells, including nerve cells and specialized cells surrounding nerves (oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells). Neurofibromin acts as a tumor suppressor, which means that it keeps cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Mutations in the NF1 gene lead to the production of a nonfunctional version of neurofibromin that cannot regulate cell growth and division. As a result, tumors such as neurofibromas can form along nerves throughout the body. It is unclear how mutations in the NF1 gene lead to the other features of neurofibromatosis type 1, such as caf-au-lait spots and learning disabilities.;Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes neurofibromin, a protein that functions as a tumor suppressor. Mutations in the NF1 gene result in the production of either a non-functional or partially functional neurofibromin protein, leading to the development of various clinical features associated with NF1. These include the formation of multiple benign tumors called neurofibromas, which can grow on nerve tissue throughout the body, pigmented skin lesions known as café-au-lait spots, distinctive bony abnormalities, and an increased risk of developing certain types of cancer, such as optic pathway glioma and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.;0.097;111.0;92.0;0.432;0.119;0.297;0.891;0.198;0.191;0.203
953;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy ?;Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy can be caused by mutations in either the EPM2A gene or the NHLRC1 gene. These genes provide instructions for making proteins called laforin and malin, respectively. Laforin and malin play a critical role in the survival of nerve cells (neurons) in the brain.  Studies suggest that laforin and malin work together and may have several functions. One of these is to help regulate the production of a complex sugar called glycogen, which is a major source of stored energy in the body. The body stores this sugar in the liver and muscles, breaking it down when it is needed for fuel. Laforin and malin may prevent a potentially damaging buildup of glycogen in tissues that do not normally store this molecule, such as those of the nervous system.  Researchers have discovered that people with Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy have distinctive clumps called Lafora bodies within their cells. Lafora bodies are made up of an abnormal form of glycogen that cannot be broken down and used for fuel. Instead, it builds up to form clumps that can damage cells. Neurons appear to be particularly vulnerable to this type of damage. Although Lafora bodies are found in many of the body's tissues, the signs and symptoms of Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy are limited to the nervous system.  Mutations in the EPM2A gene prevent cells from making functional laforin, while NHLRC1 gene mutations prevent the production of functional malin. It is unclear how a loss of either of these proteins leads to the formation of Lafora bodies. However, a loss of laforin or malin ultimately results in the death of neurons, which interferes with the brain's normal functions. The condition tends to progress more slowly in some people with NHLRC1 gene mutations than in those with EPM2A gene mutations.  Mutations in the EPM2A and NHLRC1 genes account for 80 percent to 90 percent of all cases of Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy. In the remaining cases, the cause of the condition is unknown. Researchers are searching for other genetic changes that may underlie this disease.;Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy (Lafora disease) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by seizures, myoclonus, and dementia. The genetic changes associated with Lafora disease are mutations in the EPM2A and NHLRC1 genes. Mutations in EPM2A, which encodes the laforin protein, are the most common cause of Lafora disease, accounting for approximately 60% of cases. Mutations in NHLRC1, which encodes the malin protein, are responsible for the remaining 40% of cases. These mutations lead to the accumulation of insoluble aggregates of glycogen, called Lafora bodies, in neurons and other cell types, which eventually leads to neuronal dysfunction and death.;0.013;316.0;90.0;0.321;0.09;0.189;0.852;0.114;-0.004;0.234

The seizures that occur in people with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) usually occur at night while sleeping, but some affected people also have seizures during the day. The seizures tend to occur in clusters, with each one lasting from a few seconds to a few minutes. In some people, seizures are mild and only cause a person to wake from sleep. In others, severe episodes can cause sudden, dramatic muscle spasms, wandering around, and/or crying out or making other sounds. Episodes of seizures tend to become less frequent and more mild as an affected person ages. Some people with ADNFLE experience aura, which may cause neurological symptoms such as tingling, shivering, a sense of fear, dizziness, and/or a feeling of falling or being pushed. Feelings of breathlessness, hyperventilation, and choking have also been reported. Most people with ADNFLE are intellectually normal. Psychiatric disorders, behavioral problems and intellectual disability have been described in some people with ADNFLE, but it is unclear if these features are directly related to the condition.

958;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Hypotonia ?;Hypotonia is a medical term used to describe decreased muscle tone. Normally, even when relaxed, muscles have a very small amount of contraction that gives them a springy feel and provides some resistance to passive movement. It is not the same as muscle weakness, although the two conditions can co-exist. Muscle tone is regulated by signals that travel from the brain to the nerves and tell the muscles to contract. Hypotonia can happen from damage to the brain, spinal cord, nerves, or muscles. The damage can be the result of trauma, environmental factors, or genetic, muscle, or central nervous system disorders. For example, it can be seen in Down syndrome, muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, Prader-Willi syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, and Tay-Sachs disease. Sometimes it may not be possible to find what causes the hypotonia. Infants with hypotonia have a floppy quality or rag doll appearance because their arms and legs hang by their sides and they have little or no head control. Other symptoms of hypotonia include problems with mobility and posture, breathing and speech difficulties, ligament and joint laxity, and poor reflexes. Hypotonia does not affect intellect. The opposite of hypotonia is hypertonia.;Hypotonia, also known as decreased muscle tone, is a condition characterized by abnormally low muscle tension, resulting in weak and floppy muscles. This can affect infants, children, and adults and can be caused by various factors, including genetic disorders, neurological conditions, and muscle diseases. Hypotonia can manifest as difficulty with movement, coordination, and balance, and can also impact speech and swallowing. It is important to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and management of hypotonia, as the underlying cause may require specific treatment or therapies to improve muscle strength and function.;0.018;179.0;89.0;0.295;0.054;0.168;0.87;0.117;0.007;0.229
959;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is 6q24-related transient neonatal diabetes mellitus inherited ?;Most cases of 6q24-related transient neonatal diabetes mellitus are not inherited, particularly those caused by paternal uniparental disomy. In these cases, genetic changes occur as random events during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early embryonic development. Affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family.  Sometimes, the genetic change responsible for 6q24-related transient neonatal diabetes mellitus is inherited. For example, a duplication of genetic material on the paternal chromosome 6 can be passed from one generation to the next.  When 6q24-related transient neonatal diabetes mellitus is caused by ZFP57 gene mutations, it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Autosomal recessive inheritance means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.;6q24-related transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM) is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that only one copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the condition. Individuals with TNDM have a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene on to their children. However, it is important to note that not all individuals with the mutated gene will develop TNDM, as other genetic and environmental factors may also play a role in the development of the condition.;0.063;138.0;69.0;0.361;0.138;0.236;0.766;0.097;0.049;0.142
960;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is X-linked infantile spasm syndrome inherited ?;X-linked infantile spasm syndrome can have different inheritance patterns depending on the genetic cause.  When caused by mutations in the ARX gene, this condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. The ARX gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. Usually in females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. However, in some instances, one altered copy of the ARX gene is sufficient because the X chromosome with the normal copy of the ARX gene is turned off through a process called X-inactivation. Early in embryonic development in females, one of the two X chromosomes is permanently inactivated in somatic cells (cells other than egg and sperm cells). X-inactivation ensures that females, like males, have only one active copy of the X chromosome in each body cell. Usually X-inactivation occurs randomly, such that each X chromosome is active in about half of the body cells. Sometimes X-inactivation is not random, and one X chromosome is active in more than half of cells. When X-inactivation does not occur randomly, it is called skewed X-inactivation. Some ARX gene mutations may be associated with skewed X-inactivation, which results in the inactivation of the X chromosome with the normal copy of the ARX gene in most cells of the body. This skewed X-inactivation causes the chromosome with the mutated ARX gene to be expressed in more than half of cells, causing X-linked infantile spasm syndrome.  When caused by mutations in the CDKL5 gene, this condition is thought to have an X-linked dominant inheritance pattern. The CDKL5 gene is also located on the X chromosome, making this condition X-linked. The inheritance is dominant because one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition in both males and females.  X-linked infantile spasm syndrome caused by CDKL5 gene mutations usually occurs in individuals with no history of the disorder in their family. These mutations likely occur in early embryonic development (called de novo mutations). Because males have only one X chromosome, X-linked dominant disorders are often more severe in males than in females. Male fetuses with CDKL5-related X-linked infantile spasm syndrome may not survive to birth, so more females are diagnosed with the condition. In females, the distribution of active and inactive X chromosomes due to X-inactivation may affect whether a woman develops the condition or the severity of the signs and symptoms. Generally, the larger the proportion of active X chromosomes that contain the mutated CDKL5 gene, the more severe the signs and symptoms of the condition are.  A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.;X-linked infantile spasm syndrome (ISSX) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by seizures and developmental delays. It is caused by mutations in the ARX gene, which is located on the X chromosome. ISSX is inherited in an X-linked manner, which means that it is passed down from a mother to her sons. Males are more commonly affected by ISSX than females, as males only have one X chromosome, while females have two. In females, the presence of a normal copy of the ARX gene on the other X chromosome can help to compensate for the mutation on the affected X chromosome, resulting in milder symptoms or no symptoms at all.;0.008;431.0;99.0;0.389;0.112;0.231;0.765;0.027;-0.111;0.17
961;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia ?;"Autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia is an inherited condition that mainly affects the function of red blood cells. Specifically, it alters a molecule within these cells called hemoglobin. Hemoglobin carries oxygen to cells and tissues throughout the body. In people with autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia, some of the normal hemoglobin is replaced by an abnormal form called methemoglobin, which is unable to deliver oxygen to the body's tissues. As a result, tissues in the body become oxygen deprived, leading to a bluish appearance of the skin, lips, and nails (cyanosis).  There are two forms of autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia: types I and II. People with type I have cyanosis from birth and may experience weakness or shortness of breath related to the shortage of oxygen in their tissues. People with type II have cyanosis as well as severe neurological problems. After a few months of apparently normal development, children with type II develop severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy), uncontrolled muscle tensing (dystonia), and involuntary limb movements (choreoathetosis); also, the size of their head remains small and does not grow in proportion with their body (microcephaly). People with type II have severe intellectual disability; they can recognize faces and usually babble but speak no words. They can sit unassisted and grip objects but have impaired motor skills that leave them unable to walk. In type II, growth is often slowed. Abnormal facial muscle movements can interfere with swallowing, which can lead to feeding difficulties and further slow growth.  People with autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia type I have a normal life expectancy, but people with type II often do not survive past early adulthood.";Autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia (ARCM) is a rare inherited blood disorder in which the body produces an abnormal form of hemoglobin, called methemoglobin, which cannot carry oxygen properly. This can lead to a condition known as methemoglobinemia, in which the blood is unable to deliver sufficient oxygen to the body's tissues. ARCM is caused by a mutation in the CYB5R3 gene, which encodes an enzyme called cytochrome b5 reductase. This enzyme helps to convert methemoglobin back to its normal form, hemoglobin.

SCC most often affects individuals who are exposed to large amounts of sunlight. It is typically characterized by a red papule or plaque with a scaly or crusted surface; it may be suspected whenever a small, firm reddish-colored skin lesion, growth or bump appears on the skin, but it may also be a flat growth with a curly and crusted surface. Most often these growths are located on the face, ears, neck, hands and/or arms, but they may occur on the lips, mouth, tongue, genitalia or other area. The most common causes of SCC are radiation from the sun and arsenic exposure. With appropriate treatment, it is usually curable.";Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that arises from the squamous cells, which are flat, scale-like cells found in the outer layer of the skin, the lining of the respiratory, digestive, and urinary tracts, and other areas of the body. It typically appears as a firm, scaly, or wart-like growth, and can be characterized by its tendency to spread locally and, in advanced stages, to other parts of the body through metastasis. Risk factors associated with squamous cell carcinoma include prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation, certain chemicals, radiation therapy, certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and immunosuppression. Treatment options depend on the location, size, and stage of the cancer, and may involve surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or a combination of modalities.;0.025;109.0;114.0;0.36;0.038;0.211;0.693;0.018;0.064;-0.029
963;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Tinnitus ?;Tinnitus is often described as a ringing in the ears. It also can sound like roaring, clicking, hissing, or buzzing. It may be soft or loud, high pitched or low pitched. You might hear it in either one or both ears.    Millions of Americans have tinnitus. People with severe tinnitus may have trouble hearing, working or even sleeping.    Causes of tinnitus include       - Hearing loss in older people    - Exposure to loud noises    - Ear and sinus infections    - Heart or blood vessel problems    - Meniere's disease    - Brain tumors    - Hormonal changes in women    - Thyroid problems    - Certain medicines       Treatment depends on the cause. Treatments may include hearing aids, sound-masking devices, medicines, and ways to learn how to cope with the noise.    NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders;Tinnitus is a common condition where a person perceives sound in the ears or head despite the absence of any external sound. The perceived sound can vary, often described as buzzing, ringing, hissing, or clicking and can be intermittent or constant, affecting one or both ears. Tinnitus can result from various underlying medical conditions, including hearing loss, earwax buildup, middle ear problems, head or neck injuries, certain medications, and circulatory system disorders. In most cases, it's a symptom of an underlying condition rather than a severe medical issue, but it can significantly impact a person's quality of life and be a source of distress.;0.046;120.0;94.0;0.337;0.085;0.237;0.858;0.131;0.11;0.149

                    - After ovarian low malignant potential tumor has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if abnormal cells have spread within the ovary or to other parts of the body.    - The following stages are used for ovarian low malignant potential tumor:          - Stage I     - Stage II     - Stage III     - Stage IV
                
                
                    After ovarian low malignant potential tumor has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if abnormal cells have spread within the ovary or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out whether abnormal cells have spread within the ovary or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. Certain tests or procedures are used for staging. Staging laparotomy (a surgical incision made in the wall of the abdomen to remove ovarian tissue) may be used. Most patients are diagnosed with stage I disease.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for ovarian low malignant potential tumor:
                    Stage I    In stage I, the tumor is found in one or both ovaries. Stage I is divided into stage IA, stage IB, and stage IC.             -  Stage IA: The tumor is found inside a single ovary.      -  Stage IB: The tumor is found inside both ovaries.      -  Stage IC: The tumor is found inside one or both ovaries and one of the following is true:                   - tumor cells are found on the outside surface of one or both ovaries; or        - the capsule (outer covering) of the ovary has ruptured (broken open); or        - tumor cells are found in the fluid of the peritoneal cavity (the body cavity that contains most of the organs in the abdomen) or in washings of the peritoneum (tissue lining the peritoneal cavity).                          Stage II    In stage II, the tumor is found in one or both ovaries and has spread into other areas of the pelvis. Stage II is divided into stage IIA, stage IIB, and stage IIC.             -  Stage IIA: The tumor has spread to the uterus and/or fallopian tubes (the long slender tubes through which eggs pass from the ovaries to the uterus).      -  Stage IIB: The tumor has spread to other tissue within the pelvis.      -  Stage IIC: The tumor is found inside one or both ovaries and has spread to the uterus and/or fallopian tubes, or to other tissue within the pelvis. Also, one of the following is true:                  - tumor cells are found on the outside surface of one or both ovaries; or       - the capsule (outer covering) of the ovary has ruptured (broken open); or       - tumor cells are found in the fluid of the peritoneal cavity (the body cavity that contains most of the organs in the abdomen) or in washings of the peritoneum (tissue lining the peritoneal cavity).                         Stage III     In stage III, the tumor is found in one or both ovaries and has spread outside the pelvis to other parts of the abdomen and/or nearby lymph nodes. Stage III is divided into stage IIIA, stage IIIB, and stage IIIC.             -  Stage IIIA: The tumor is found in the pelvis only, but tumor cells that can be seen only with a microscope have spread to the surface of the peritoneum (tissue that lines the abdominal wall and covers most of the organs in the abdomen), the small intestines, or the tissue that connects the small intestines to the wall of the abdomen.      -  Stage IIIB: The tumor has spread to the peritoneum and the tumor in the peritoneum is 2 centimeters or smaller.      -  Stage IIIC: The tumor has spread to the peritoneum and the tumor in the peritoneum is larger than 2 centimeters and/or has spread to lymph nodes in the abdomen.           The spread of tumor cells to the surface of the liver is also considered stage III disease.        Stage IV     In stage IV, tumor cells have spread beyond the abdomen to other parts of the body, such as the lungs or tissue inside the liver.     Tumor cells in the fluid around the lungs is also considered stage IV disease.     Ovarian low malignant potential tumors almost never reach stage IV.";"Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumors (LMP) are classified into three stages based on the extent of disease spread:

Stage I: Confined to the ovary or ovaries.

Stage II: Involves one or both ovaries and the pelvis.

Stage III: Involves the ovaries and has spread beyond the pelvis to the abdomen or distant sites like the liver or lungs.

Accurate staging is essential for determining the appropriate treatment and prognosis for patients with Ovarian LMP Tumors.";0.0;596.0;67.0;0.35;0.103;0.27;0.691;-0.076;-0.241;0.099
965;gemini-pro;treatment;What are the treatments for Tabes Dorsalis ?;Penicillin, administered intravenously, is the treatment of choice. Associated pain can be treated with opiates, valproate, or carbamazepine. Patients may also require physical or rehabilitative therapy to deal with muscle wasting and weakness. Preventive treatment for those who come into sexual contact with an individual with tabes dorsalis is important.;Tabes dorsalis, a neurosyphilis condition, has various treatment options. Penicillin is the primary treatment for early-stage syphilis, and it can also be effective in treating early-stage tabes dorsalis. For advanced cases, penicillin may be combined with other treatments such as corticosteroids to reduce inflammation, anticonvulsants to control seizures, and physical therapy or occupational therapy to address neurological impairments. Symptomatic treatment may also include pain relievers, muscle relaxants, and assistive devices like canes or wheelchairs to improve mobility. Regular monitoring and management of underlying syphilis infection are crucial to prevent further progression of tabes dorsalis and associated complications.;0.019;48.0;95.0;0.354;0.058;0.248;0.686;-0.008;0.054;-0.072
966;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome ?;"Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome often results from a combination of environmental and genetic factors. Mutations in at least seven genes appear to increase the risk of developing the disorder. Mutations in a gene called CFH are most common; they have been found in about 30 percent of all cases of atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Mutations in the other genes have each been identified in a smaller percentage of cases.  The genes associated with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome provide instructions for making proteins involved in a part of the body's immune response known as the complement system. This system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders (such as bacteria and viruses), trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. The complement system must be carefully regulated so it targets only unwanted materials and does not attack the body's healthy cells. The regulatory proteins associated with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome protect healthy cells by preventing activation of the complement system when it is not needed.  Mutations in the genes associated with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome lead to uncontrolled activation of the complement system. The overactive system attacks cells that line blood vessels in the kidneys, causing inflammation and the formation of abnormal clots. These abnormalities lead to kidney damage and, in many cases, kidney failure and ESRD.  Although gene mutations increase the risk of atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, studies suggest that they are often not sufficient to cause the disease. In people with certain genetic changes, the signs and symptoms of the disorder may be triggered by factors including certain medications (such as anticancer drugs), chronic diseases, viral or bacterial infections, cancers, organ transplantation, or pregnancy.  Some people with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome do not have any known genetic changes or environmental triggers for the disease. In these cases, the disorder is described as idiopathic.";Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a rare, life-threatening disorder characterized by the destruction of red blood cells, low platelet count, and kidney failure. It is caused by genetic mutations that impair the regulation of the complement system, a part of the immune system that helps the body fight infection. The most common genetic changes associated with aHUS are mutations in the genes encoding complement factor H (CFH), complement factor I (CFI), membrane cofactor protein (MCP), and thrombomodulin (THBD). These mutations lead to dysregulation of the complement system, resulting in excessive activation of the complement cascade, which can damage red blood cells, platelets, and the lining of the blood vessels in the kidneys.;0.016;276.0;98.0;0.324;0.103;0.171;0.813;-0.009;-0.073;0.054
967;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to primary myelofibrosis ?;Mutations in the JAK2, MPL, CALR, and TET2 genes are associated with most cases of primary myelofibrosis. The JAK2 and MPL genes provide instructions for making proteins that promote the growth and division (proliferation) of blood cells. The CALR gene provides instructions for making a protein with multiple functions, including ensuring the proper folding of newly formed proteins and maintaining the correct levels of stored calcium in cells. The TET2 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unknown.  The proteins produced from the JAK2 and MPL genes are both part of a signaling pathway called the JAK/STAT pathway, which transmits chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. The protein produced from the MPL gene, called thrombopoietin receptor, turns on (activates) the pathway, and the JAK2 protein transmits signals after activation. Through the JAK/STAT pathway, these two proteins promote the proliferation of blood cells, particularly a type of blood cell known as a megakaryocyte.  Mutations in either the JAK2 gene or the MPL gene that are associated with primary myelofibrosis lead to overactivation of the JAK/STAT pathway. The abnormal activation of JAK/STAT signaling leads to overproduction of abnormal megakaryocytes, and these megakaryocytes stimulate another type of cell to release collagen. Collagen is a protein that normally provides structural support for the cells in the bone marrow. However, in primary myelofibrosis, the excess collagen forms scar tissue in the bone marrow.  Although mutations in the CALR gene and the TET2 gene are relatively common in primary myelofibrosis, it is unclear how these mutations are involved in the development of the condition.  Some people with primary myelofibrosis do not have a mutation in any of the known genes associated with this condition. Researchers are working to identify other genes that may be involved in the condition.;Myelofriesdicid;0.0;260.0;1.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.19;-0.513;-0.602;-0.426

969;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) laryngo-onycho-cutaneous syndrome ?;"Laryngo-onycho-cutaneous (LOC) syndrome is a disorder that leads to abnormalities of the voicebox (laryngo-), finger- and toenails (onycho-), and skin (cutaneous). Many of the condition's signs and symptoms are related to the abnormal growth of granulation tissue in different parts of the body. This red, bumpy tissue is normally produced during wound healing and is usually replaced by skin cells as healing continues. However, in people with LOC syndrome, this tissue grows even when there is no major injury.  One of the first symptoms in infants with LOC syndrome is a hoarse cry due to ulcers or overgrowth of granulation tissue in the voicebox (the larynx). Excess granulation tissue can also block the airways, leading to life-threatening breathing problems; as a result many affected individuals do not survive past childhood.  In LOC syndrome, granulation tissue also grows in the eyes, specifically the conjunctiva, which are the moist tissues that line the eyelids and the white part of the eyes. Affected individuals often have impairment or complete loss of vision due to the tissue overgrowth.  Another common feature of LOC syndrome is missing patches of skin (cutaneous erosions). The erosions heal slowly and may become infected. People with LOC syndrome can also have malformed nails and small, abnormal teeth. The hard, white material that forms the protective outer layer of each tooth (enamel) is thin, which contributes to frequent cavities.  LOC syndrome is typically considered a subtype of another skin condition called junctional epidermolysis bullosa, which is characterized by fragile skin that blisters easily. While individuals with junctional epidermolysis bullosa can have some of the features of LOC syndrome, they do not usually have overgrowth of granulation tissue in the conjunctiva.";Laryngo-onycho-cutaneous syndrome is a rare inherited disease characterized by a triad of symptoms including laryngomalacia, onychodystrophy, and skin abnormalities. Laryngomalacia refers to a floppy, collapsing cartilage structure in the throat, causing noisy breathing in infants. Onychodystrophy involves malformation of the nails, making them brittle and easily broken. Skin abnormalities may include excessive skin folds, loose skin, and skin tags. Additional symptoms may also include gastrointestinal issues, such as esophageal diverticula and gastroesophagal reflex disease (GERD).

Some notable research areas include:

* Exploring the role of genetics and epigenetics in dermatomyositis: Researchers are investigating the genetic and epigenetic factors that contribute to the development and progression of the disease. This research aims to identify potential genetic markers that can aid in early diagnosis, predict disease severity, and personalize treatment approaches.

* Investigating the immune system's involvement in dermatomyositis: Clinical trials are evaluating the efficacy of immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive therapies in treating dermatomyositis. These studies aim to modulate the immune response, reduce inflammation, and improve muscle strength and skin manifestations.

* Evaluating novel therapeutic agents: Several clinical trials are assessing the effectiveness and safety of new medications, including targeted therapies, biologics, and small molecules, in treating dermatomyositis. These agents aim to inhibit specific molecules or pathways involved in the disease process, thereby improving disease outcomes.

* Studying the long-term effects of dermatomyositis: Researchers are conducting observational studies to assess the long-term impact of dermatomyositis on patients' physical, psychological, and social well-being. These studies aim to identify factors that contribute to long-term complications and develop strategies for improving long-term outcomes.

978;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Pneumonia ?;"Pneumonia (nu-MO-ne-ah) is an infection in one or both of the lungs. Many germssuch as bacteria, viruses, and fungican cause pneumonia.
                
The infection inflames your lungs' air sacs, which are called alveoli (al-VEE-uhl-eye). The air sacs may fill up with fluid or pus, causing symptoms such as a cough with phlegm (a slimy substance), fever, chills, and trouble breathing.
                
Overview
                
Pneumonia and its symptoms can vary from mild to severe. Many factors affect how serious pneumonia is, such as the type of germ causing the infection and your age and overall health.
                
Pneumonia tends to be more serious for:
                
Infants and young children.
                
Older adults (people 65 years or older).
                
People who have other health problems, such as heart failure, diabetes, or COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
                
People who have weak immune systems as a result of diseases or other factors. Examples of these diseases and factors include HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy (a treatment for cancer), and an organ transplant or blood and marrow stem cell transplant.
                
Outlook
                
Pneumonia is common in the United States. Treatment for pneumonia depends on its cause, how severe your symptoms are, and your age and overall health. Many people can be treated at home, often with oral antibiotics.
                
Children usually start to feel better in 1 to 2 days. For adults, it usually takes 2 to 3 days. Anyone who has worsening symptoms should see a doctor.
                
People who have severe symptoms or underlying health problems may need treatment in a hospital. It may take 3 weeks or more before they can go back to their normal routines.
                
Fatigue (tiredness) from pneumonia can last for a month or more.";Pneumonia is an infection of one or both lungs caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. It can cause inflammation of the air sacs in the lungs (alveoli), leading to fluid or pus-filled alveoli. This can result in symptoms such as cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, and fever. Pneumonia can vary in severity from mild to life-threatening, and it is particularly dangerous for young children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems.

Mutations in other genes may cause a small percentage of cases. Other suspected causes of PVOD include viral infection and exposure to toxic chemicals, including certain chemotherapy drugs.  The protein produced from the EIF2AK4 gene helps cells respond appropriately to changes that could damage the cell. For example, when the level of protein building blocks (amino acids) in a cell falls too low, the activity of the EIF2AK4 protein helps reduce the production of other proteins, which conserves amino acids. The EIF2AK4 gene mutations involved in PVOD likely eliminate functional EIF2AK4 protein; however, it is unknown how absence of this protein's function leads to the pulmonary vessel abnormalities that underlie PVOD.";Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD), a rare but severe disorder, is characterized by the obstruction of small pulmonary veins, leading to pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure. Genetic variations in several genes have been associated with PVOD, including: mutations in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha kinase 4 (EIF2AK4) gene, mutations in the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) gene, mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 (BMPR2) gene, and mutations in the activin A receptor type II-like 1 (ACVRL1) gene.

985;gemini-pro;considerations;What to do for Urine Blockage in Newborns ?;- Many types of defects in the urinary tract can cause urine blockage:     - vesicoureteral reflux (VUR)    - ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction    - bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), such as posterior urethral valves (PUV)    - ureterocele    - Some babies are born with genetic conditions that affect several different systems in the body, including the urinary tract:     - prune belly syndrome (PBS)    - esophageal atresia (EA)    - congenital heart defects    - Urine blockage can also be caused by spina bifida and other birth defects that affect the spinal cord.  - Before leaving the hospital, a baby with urine blockage may urinate only small amounts or may not urinate at all. As part of the routine newborn exam, the health care provider may feel an enlarged kidney or find a closed urethra, which may indicate urine blockage. Sometimes urine blockage is not apparent until a child develops symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI).  - When a defect in the urinary tract blocks the flow of urine, the urine backs up and causes the ureters to swell, called hydroureter, and hydronephrosis.  - Defects of the urinary tract may be discovered before or after the baby is born.  - Prenatal tests include ultrasound, amniocentesis, and chorionic villus sampling (CVS).  - Different imaging techniques, including ultrasound, voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG), and radionuclide scan, can be used in infants and children to determine the cause of urine blockage.  - Treatment for urine blockage depends on the cause and severity of the blockage. Hydronephrosis discovered before the baby is born rarely requires immediate action, especially if it is only on one side. Treatments for more serious conditions include     - surgery    - antibiotics    - intermittent catheterization;In cases of urine blockage in newborns, immediate medical attention is crucial. If the blockage is caused by a structural abnormality, such as posterior urethral valves or urethral atresia, surgical intervention may be necessary to correct the defect and allow for proper urine flow. Delay in treatment can lead to serious complications, including kidney damage, bladder rupture, and sepsis. In some cases, a less invasive procedure, such as dilation of the urethra, may be sufficient to relieve the blockage.

988;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to vitiligo ?;Variations in over 30 genes, occurring in different combinations, have been associated with an increased risk of developing vitiligo. Two of these genes are NLRP1 and PTPN22. The NLRP1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the immune system, helping to regulate the process of inflammation. Inflammation occurs when the immune system sends signaling molecules and white blood cells to a site of injury or disease to fight microbial invaders and facilitate tissue repair. The body then stops (inhibits) the inflammatory response to prevent damage to its own cells and tissues.  The PTPN22 gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in signaling that helps control the activity of immune system cells called T cells. T cells identify foreign substances and defend the body against infection.  The variations in the NLRP1 and PTPN22 genes that are associated with an increased risk of developing vitiligo likely affect the activity of the NLRP1 and PTPN22 proteins, making it more difficult for the body to control inflammation and prevent the immune system from attacking its own tissues.  Studies indicate that variations in a number of other genes also affect the risk of vitiligo. Many of these genes are also involved in immune system function or melanocyte biology, and variations in each likely make only a small contribution to vitiligo risk. Some of the gene changes associated with an increased risk of vitiligo have also been associated with an increased risk of other autoimmune conditions.  It is unclear what specific circumstances trigger the immune system to attack melanocytes in the skin. Research suggests that the immune system of affected individuals may react abnormally to melanocytes that are stressed by factors such as chemicals or ultraviolet radiation. In addition, the melanocytes of people with vitiligo may be more susceptible to stress than those of the general population and therefore may be more likely to be attacked by the immune system. The condition probably results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, most of which have not been identified.;Vitiligo, a skin condition characterized by the loss of pigment in patches of skin, is associated with various genetic changes. One prevalent genetic factor linked to vitiligo is mutations in the NAAGpeptidase gene (NAAG). Mutations in this gene disrupt the production of N-acetylaspartylglutamic acid (NAAG), a neuropeptide involved in the regulation of melanocyte function. Additionally, variations in genes responsible for immune system regulation, such as PTPN22, CTLA-4, and IL-2RA, have been implicated in the development of vitiligo. These genetic variations influence immune responses, potentially leading to the autoimmune attack on melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells. Furthermore, genetic variations in melanocyte-specific genes, including MC1R, SLC24A5, and TYR, have been associated with an increased susceptibility to vitiligo, impacting melanocyte development, function, and survival. Understanding these genetic alterations enhances our knowledge of the disease mechanisms and aids in the development of targeted therapies for vitiligo.;0.017;304.0;129.0;0.293;0.054;0.172;0.688;0.024;-0.013;0.059

992;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to Leigh syndrome ?;Leigh syndrome can be caused by mutations in one of over 30 different genes. In humans, most genes are found in DNA in the cell's nucleus, called nuclear DNA. However, some genes are found in DNA in specialized structures in the cell called mitochondria. This type of DNA is known as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). While most people with Leigh syndrome have a mutation in nuclear DNA, about 20 to 25 percent have a mutation in mtDNA.  Most genes associated with Leigh syndrome are involved in the process of energy production in mitochondria. Mitochondria use oxygen to convert the energy from food into a form cells can use. Five protein complexes, made up of several proteins each, are involved in this process, called oxidative phosphorylation. The complexes are named complex I, complex II, complex III, complex IV, and complex V. During oxidative phosphorylation, the protein complexes drive the production of ATP, the cell's main energy source, through a step-by-step transfer of negatively charged particles called electrons. Many of the gene mutations associated with Leigh syndrome affect proteins in complexes I, II, IV, or V or disrupt the assembly of these complexes. These mutations reduce or eliminate the activity of one or more of these complexes, which can lead to Leigh syndrome.  Disruption of complex IV, also called cytochrome c oxidase or COX, is the most common cause of Leigh syndrome. The most frequently mutated gene in COX-deficient Leigh syndrome is called SURF1. This gene, which is found in nuclear DNA, provides instructions for making a protein that helps assemble the COX protein complex (complex IV). The COX protein complex, which is involved in the last step of electron transfer in oxidative phosphorylation, provides the energy that will be used in the next step of the process to generate ATP. Mutations in the SURF1 gene typically lead to an abnormally short SURF1 protein that is broken down in cells, resulting in the absence of functional SURF1 protein. The loss of this protein reduces the formation of normal COX complexes, which impairs mitochondrial energy production.  Other nuclear DNA mutations associated with Leigh syndrome decrease the activity of other oxidative phosphorylation protein complexes or affect additional steps related to energy production. For example, Leigh syndrome can be caused by mutations in genes that form the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. These mutations lead to a shortage of pyruvate dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in mitochondrial energy production.  The most common mtDNA mutation in Leigh syndrome affects the MT-ATP6 gene, which provides instructions for making a piece of complex V, also known as the ATP synthase protein complex. Using the energy provided by the other protein complexes, the ATP synthase complex generates ATP. MT-ATP6 gene mutations, found in 10 to 20 percent of people with Leigh syndrome, block the generation of ATP. Other mtDNA mutations associated with Leigh syndrome decrease the activity of other oxidative phosphorylation protein complexes or lead to reduced mitochondrial protein synthesis, all of which impair mitochondrial energy production.  Although the exact mechanism is unclear, researchers believe that impaired oxidative phosphorylation can lead to cell death because of decreased energy available in the cell. Certain tissues that require large amounts of energy, such as the brain, muscles, and heart, seem especially sensitive to decreases in cellular energy. Cell death in the brain likely causes the characteristic lesions seen in Leigh syndrome, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of the condition. Cell death in other sensitive tissues may also contribute to the features of Leigh syndrome.;Leigh syndrome, a severe pediatric neurodegenerative disorder, is genetically heterogeneous with mutations identified in dozens of nuclear and mitochondrial genes. The most common genetic cause of Leigh syndrome are mutations in mitochondrial genes, which encode essential components of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system, responsible for cellular energy production. Mitochondrial DNA mutations, particularly in genes encoding subunits of mitochondrial complexes I, IV, and V, are frequently implicated. Additionally, mutations in nuclear genes encoding proteins involved in mitochondrial function, such as assembly factors, carrier proteins, and regulators of mitochondrial dynamics, can also lead to Leigh syndrome. These genetic alterations impair mitochondrial function, leading to energy deficits, oxidative stress, and ultimately neuronal damage and dysfunction.;0.002;531.0;109.0;0.287;0.085;0.169;0.831;-0.035;-0.155;0.088

                    Osteosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of the bone are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells form in bone.
                    Osteosarcoma usually starts in osteoblasts, which are a type of bone cell that becomes new bone tissue. Osteosarcoma is most common in adolescents. It commonly forms in the ends of the long bones of the body, which include bones of the arms and legs. In children and adolescents, it often forms in the bones near the knee. Rarely, osteosarcoma may be found in soft tissue or organs in the chest or abdomen.   Osteosarcoma is the most common type of bone cancer. Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of bone is a rare tumor of the bone. It is treated like osteosarcoma.     Ewing sarcoma is another kind of bone cancer, but it is not covered in this summary. See the PDQ summary about Ewing Sarcoma Treatment for more information.";Osteosarcoma and Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma of Bone (MFH) are aggressive primary bone tumors with a high metastatic potential. Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents, characterized by the formation of immature bone tissue. MFH is more prevalent in adults, known for its rapid and invasive growth, and its tendency to metastasize to the lungs and other bones. Both tumors exhibit similar clinical features, including localized pain, swelling, and impaired mobility in the affected area. These tumors require prompt diagnosis and aggressive treatment, typically involving surgical resection followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

994;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Joubert syndrome ?;"Joubert syndrome is disorder of abnormal brain development that may affect many parts of the body. It is characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the cerebellar vermis (a part of the brain that controls balance and coordination) and a malformed brain stem (connection between the brain and spinal cord). This gives a characteristic appearance of a molar tooth sign on MRI. Signs and symptoms can vary but commonly include weak muscle tone (hypotonia); abnormal breathing patterns; abnormal eye movements; ataxia; distinctive facial features; and intellectual disability. Various other abnormalities may also be present. Joubert syndrome may be caused by mutations in any of many genes and is predominantly inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Rarely it may be inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. Treatment is supportive and depends on the symptoms in each person.";Joubert syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a distinctive brain malformation called the molar tooth sign, which is observed on brain imaging. This malformation affects the cerebellum and brainstem, leading to a wide range of neurological problems. The syndrome is associated with intellectual disability, hypotonia (low muscle tone), ataxia (impaired coordination and balance), and breathing difficulties. Additional features may include seizures, eye movement abnormalities, nystagmus (involuntary rapid eye movements), and liver or kidney problems. Joubert syndrome is caused by mutations in genes involved in neuronal migration and development, and inheritance patterns vary depending on the specific genetic cause.;0.058;124.0;93.0;0.475;0.125;0.262;0.939;0.298;0.233;0.361

This, combined with all of the weight they carry, explains why feet can have problems. To keep your feet healthy       -  Examine your feet regularly    -  Wear comfortable shoes that fit    -  Wash your feet daily with soap and lukewarm water     -  Trim your toenails straight across and not too short       Your foot health can be a clue to your overall health. For example, joint stiffness could mean arthritis. Tingling or numbness could be a sign of diabetes. Swelling might indicate kidney disease, heart disease, or high blood pressure.    Good foot care and regular foot checks are an important part of your health care. If you have foot problems, be sure to talk to your doctor.     NIH: National Institute on Aging;Foot health is essential for overall well-being. Taking care of your feet includes keeping them clean and dry, trimming toenails straight across, wearing properly fitted and supportive shoes, and moisturizing regularly. Common foot problems include athlete's foot, blisters, corns and calluses, hammertoes, bunions, and plantar fasciitis. Practicing good foot hygiene, choosing appropriate footwear, and addressing foot problems promptly can help maintain healthy feet. Regular foot check-ups with a healthcare professional are recommended for individuals with certain conditions like diabetes or poor circulation.;0.024;127.0;81.0;0.289;0.079;0.138;0.728;0.076;0.045;0.103
996;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to hypomyelination and congenital cataract ?;Mutations in the FAM126A gene cause hypomyelination and congenital cataract. The FAM126A gene provides instructions for making a protein called hyccin, the function of which is not completely understood. Based on the features of hypomyelination and congenital cataract, researchers presume that hyccin is involved in the formation of myelin throughout the nervous system. Hyccin is also active in the lens of the eye, the heart, and the kidneys. It is unclear how mutations in the FAM126A gene cause cataracts.  Most FAM126A gene mutations that cause hypomyelination and congenital cataract prevent the production of hyccin. People who cannot produce any hyccin have problems forming myelin, leading to the signs and symptoms of this condition.  People who have mutations that allow some protein production tend to have milder symptoms than those who produce no protein. These individuals typically retain the ability to walk longer, although they still need support, and they usually do not have peripheral neuropathy.;Hypomyelination and congenital cataracts are frequently caused by genetic variations that disrupt the normal development and function of cells responsible for myelin formation and lens transparency. Mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in myelin synthesis, such as myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1), can lead to hypomyelination. These mutations can alter the structure or function of these proteins, resulting in abnormal myelin formation and impaired nerve conduction. Similarly, mutations in genes encoding lens proteins, such as crystallins, can cause congenital cataracts by disrupting the normal transparency and refractive properties of the lens. These genetic changes can be inherited in different patterns, including autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked inheritance, affecting individuals in various populations.;0.023;140.0;113.0;0.244;0.044;0.141;0.787;0.047;0.047;0.043
997;gemini-pro;information;What is (are) Chediak-Higashi syndrome ?;"Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body, particularly the immune system. This disease damages immune system cells, leaving them less able to fight off invaders such as viruses and bacteria. As a result, most people with Chediak-Higashi syndrome have repeated and persistent infections starting in infancy or early childhood. These infections tend to be very serious or life-threatening.  Chediak-Higashi syndrome is also characterized by a condition called oculocutaneous albinism, which causes abnormally light coloring (pigmentation) of the skin, hair, and eyes. Affected individuals typically have fair skin and light-colored hair, often with a metallic sheen. Oculocutaneous albinism also causes vision problems such as reduced sharpness; rapid, involuntary eye movements (nystagmus); and increased sensitivity to light (photophobia).  Many people with Chediak-Higashi syndrome have problems with blood clotting (coagulation) that lead to easy bruising and abnormal bleeding. In adulthood, Chediak-Higashi syndrome can also affect the nervous system, causing weakness, clumsiness, difficulty with walking, and seizures.  If the disease is not successfully treated, most children with Chediak-Higashi syndrome reach a stage of the disorder known as the accelerated phase. This severe phase of the disease is thought to be triggered by a viral infection. In the accelerated phase, white blood cells (which normally help fight infection) divide uncontrollably and invade many of the body's organs. The accelerated phase is associated with fever, episodes of abnormal bleeding, overwhelming infections, and organ failure. These medical problems are usually life-threatening in childhood.  A small percentage of people with Chediak-Higashi syndrome have a milder form of the condition that appears later in life. People with the adult form of the disorder have less noticeable changes in pigmentation and are less likely to have recurrent, severe infections. They do, however, have a significant risk of progressive neurological problems such as tremors, difficulty with movement and balance (ataxia), reduced sensation and weakness in the arms and legs (peripheral neuropathy), and a decline in intellectual functioning.";Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a defect in the formation and function of lysosomes, which are organelles responsible for cellular waste disposal and recycling. This defect leads to the accumulation of undegraded material within cells, causing a variety of health problems. Common features of Chediak-Higashi syndrome include oculocutaneous albinism (reduced pigmentation of the skin, hair, and eyes), nystagmus (rapid, involuntary eye movements), photophobia (sensitivity to light), recurrent infections due to impaired immune function, and pancytopenia (decreased production of blood cells). The severity of symptoms can vary widely among individuals, with some experiencing life-threatening complications and others having a milder form of the disorder. Treatment is supportive and may involve regular blood transfusions, antibiotics, and management of infections.

In rare cases, heart transplantation is needed.;Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a rare congenital heart condition characterized by the presence of prominent trabeculations and deep intertrabecular recesses in the left ventricle, resulting in a sponge-like appearance. It can lead to a range of clinical manifestations, including heart failure, arrhythmias, stroke, and systemic embolism. The exact cause of LVNC is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a defect in the formation of the ventricular myocardium during embryonic development. LVNC can be diagnosed using echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT) scanning.

The cause of the remaining cases remains unknown. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.;Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS) is a rare genetic disorder that affects multiple organ systems, primarily characterized by periodic paralysis, cardiac arrhythmias, and distinctive facial features. The periodic paralysis causes episodes of muscle weakness or complete paralysis, often triggered by stress, cold temperatures, or high-potassium meals. Cardiac arrhythmias, particularly long QT syndrome, increase the risk of potentially life-threatening heart rhythm disturbances.

1001;gemini-pro;genetic changes;What are the genetic changes related to sitosterolemia ?;"Sitosterolemia is caused by mutations in the ABCG5 or ABCG8 gene. These genes provide instructions for making the two halves of a protein called sterolin. This protein is involved in eliminating plant sterols, which cannot be used by human cells.  Sterolin is a transporter protein, which is a type of protein that moves substances across cell membranes. It is found mostly in cells of the intestines and liver. After plant sterols in food are taken into intestinal cells, the sterolin transporters in these cells pump them back into the intestinal tract, decreasing absorption. Sterolin transporters in liver cells pump the plant sterols into a fluid called bile that is released into the intestine. From the intestine, the plant sterols are eliminated with the feces. This process removes most of the dietary plant sterols, and allows only about 5 percent of these substances to get into the bloodstream. Sterolin also helps regulate cholesterol levels in a similar fashion; normally about 50 percent of cholesterol in the diet is absorbed by the body.  Mutations in the ABCG5 or ABCG8 gene that cause sitosterolemia result in a defective sterolin transporter and impair the elimination of plant sterols and, to a lesser degree, cholesterol from the body. These fatty substances build up in the arteries, skin, and other tissues, resulting in atherosclerosis, xanthomas, and the additional signs and symptoms of sitosterolemia. Excess plant sterols, such as sitosterol, in red blood cells likely make their cell membranes stiff and prone to rupture, leading to hemolytic anemia. Changes in the lipid composition of the membranes of red blood cells and platelets may account for the other blood abnormalities that sometimes occur in sitosterolemia.";In sitosterolemia, genetic alterations affect the activity or expression of proteins involved in the absorption, transport, and metabolism of plant sterols. The most common genetic cause is mutations in the ABCG5 and ABCG8 genes, which encode sterolin-1 and sterolin-2, respectively. These proteins are responsible for transporting plant sterols from the enterocytes back into the intestinal lumen, preventing their absorption. Mutations in these genes can lead to increased absorption and accumulation of plant sterols in the body, resulting in the development of sitosterolemia. Additionally, mutations in the CYP7B1 gene, which encodes the enzyme responsible for the conversion of plant sterols to bile acids, can also contribute to the accumulation of plant sterols in the body and the development of sitosterolemia.;0.017;248.0;105.0;0.315;0.083;0.162;0.878;0.144;0.028;0.263

There are currently no treatments known to prevent or slow the progression of Troyer syndrome. Treatment aims to relieve symptoms of the disease and improve quality of life. Treatment for spasticity involves both exercise and medication, especially baclofen (Lioresal), which is used either orally or by intrathecal pump. Tizanidine, dantrolene (with precautions), and Botox have also been useful in reducing muscle spasticity. Daily physical therapy is recommended.

They may develop a somewhat flat face and distinctive-looking facial features that are described as ""coarse."" Temporarily delayed development and weak muscle tone (hypotonia) have also been reported.  Young children with sialuria tend to have frequent upper respiratory infections and episodes of dehydration and stomach upset (gastroenteritis). Older children may have seizures and learning difficulties. In some affected children, intellectual development is nearly normal.  The features of sialuria vary widely among affected people.

1005;gemini-pro;inheritance;Is Von Willebrand disease inherited ?;Is von Willebrand disease always inherited from a parent? Most, but not all, cases of von Willebrand disease (VWD) are inherited. The majority of cases of type 1 and type 2A, as well as type 2B and type 2M, are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. VWD type 2N, type 3, and some cases of type 1 and type 2A are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Most individuals with an autosomal dominant type of VWD have an affected parent. However, some individuals are affected due to having a new (de novo) mutation in the VWF gene that occurred for the first time in the affected individual. If the mutation found in the affected individual cannot be detected in either parent, it is most often due to a de novo mutation but may also be due to germline mosaicism in a parent. Possible non-medical explanations which may be explored include alternate paternity or maternity (e.g., with assisted reproduction) or undisclosed adoption. There is also a separate, rare condition called acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS). This is a mild to moderate bleeding disorder that is typically seen in conjunction with other disorders, such as diseases that affect bone marrow or immune cell function. AVWS is not caused by a mutation in the VWF gene and usually begins in adulthood.;Yes, von Willebrand disease is typically inherited, with the majority of cases caused by mutations in the VWF gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called von Willebrand factor, which is essential for normal blood clotting. Inherited forms of von Willebrand disease can be passed down in either an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner. In the autosomal dominant form, only one copy of the mutated gene is needed to cause the disorder, while in the autosomal recessive form, both copies of the gene must be mutated.;0.026;200.0;80.0;0.339;0.113;0.17;0.863;0.092;-0.061;0.253

                    After childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body is called staging. The results of tests and procedures used to diagnose non-Hodgkin lymphoma may also be used for staging. See the General Information section for a description of these tests and procedures. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.    The following procedure also may be used to determine the stage:         -   Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma:
                    Stage I     In stage I childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma, cancer is found:            - in one group of lymph nodes; or     - in one area outside the lymph nodes.           No cancer is found in the abdomen or mediastinum (area between the lungs).       Stage II     In stage II childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma, cancer is found:            - in one area outside the lymph nodes and in nearby lymph nodes; or     - in two or more areas either above or below the diaphragm, and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes; or     - to have started in the stomach or intestines and can be completely removed by surgery. Cancer may have spread to certain nearby lymph nodes.              Stage III     In stage III childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma, cancer is found:            - in at least one area above the diaphragm and in at least one area below the diaphragm; or     - to have started in the chest; or     - to have started in the abdomen and spread throughout the abdomen; or     - in the area around the spine.              Stage IV     In stage IV childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma, cancer is found in the bone marrow, brain, or cerebrospinal fluid. Cancer may also be found in other parts of the body.";"Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) is classified into distinct stages based on the extent of tumor involvement at diagnosis. The most commonly used staging system is the St. Jude Staging System, which categorizes NHL into four stages:

Stage I: The tumor is localized to a single lymph node group or extranodal site.

Stage II: The tumor involves two or more lymph node groups on the same side of the diaphragm.

Stage III: The tumor involves lymph node groups on both sides of the diaphragm, or involves extranodal sites with or without lymph node involvement.

Stage IV: The tumor involves one or more extranodal organs or tissues, with or without lymph node involvement.";0.001;458.0;100.0;0.255;0.05;0.194;0.622;-0.192;-0.291;-0.094
